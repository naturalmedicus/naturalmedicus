When buying reusable menstrual pads it is best to avoid synthetic materials as these are endocrine disruptors.
Another benefit of using fabric menstrual pads is they do not have the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) which is a rare life threatening condition caused by bacteria getting inside the body and releasing harmful toxins.
2. Natural sea sponge tampons
Natural sea sponge tampons is the second best choice for non-toxic menstrual product alternative.
