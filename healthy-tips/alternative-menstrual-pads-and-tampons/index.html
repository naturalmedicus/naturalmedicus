    <meta name="description" content="One of the greatest issue in our environment is the pollution and toxins that end up in landfills. Menstrual products have a really harmful impact on the environment but even worse is the impact it can have on your overall health by using them.
Menstrual pads and tampons often have chemicals and toxin that should be avoided for healthy natural living. Here are several alternatives to menstrual products that are healthier options.

Reusable organic menstrual pads made out of organic cotton or bamboo fabric are the top on this list. They are reusable and can last a long time with proper care. They replace the common disposable sanitary towels. There are non-organic available but buying organic is far better investment in your health as there is no chemicals used in the fabric.
With proper care they can last a really long time and will save you more money than if you used disposable sanitary pads. At the end of the lifecycle of cloth pads they can be added to a compost to rot and return to the earth which makes them highly environmentally friendly.
When buying reusable menstrual pads it is best to avoid synthetic materials as these are endocrine disruptors.
Another benefit of using fabric menstrual pads is they do not have the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) which is a rare life threatening condition caused by bacteria getting inside the body and releasing harmful toxins.
2. Natural sea sponge tampons
Natural sea sponge tampons is the second best choice for non-toxic menstrual product alternative.
The natural sea sponges can easily be trimmed to create perfect fit.
These sponges contain thousands of pores that make them highly absorbent while maintaining a soft and silky texture giving comfort and absorbing efficiently during menstrual cycle.
There are bleached and unbleached sponges available for purchase. It is recommended to go for unbleached versions as they are less toxic and retain their natural antibacterial properties, durability and absorbency.
Unlike synthetic sponges, natural sea sponge does not generate harmful static electricity and is suitable for everyday use.
With proper care and maintenance they can be reused and once worn out simply discard in a compost pile or other facility. Using natural sea sponges has a positive impact on the environment as they are a naturally renewable resource.
Although using natural sea sponge or other healthier and also environmentally friendly tampons than the synthetic types the use of these can put you at risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) which is a rare life threatening condition.
3. Organic cotton tampons

Although menstrual cups made from silicone are not natural they are an option for those who want a durable lasting product. A menstrual cup will need to be sanitized for reuse.
Silicone is not biodegradable, but it can be recycled easily in recycling facilities.
