<h2>Natural Air Freshener Gels</h2>
<p>These fresheners are a perfect replacement for the conventional air fresheners you will find at most supermarkets.</p>
<p>Try this easy recipe to make your own at home with simple ingredients:</p>
<p><strong>You will need</strong></p>
<p>Pot for boiling</p>
<p>Whisk or spoon for mixing</p>
<p>Glass jars (baby food jars can be useful for this for their size)</p>
<p>4 packets / envelopes of unflavored gelatine or 1-oz</p>
<p>2 separate cups of water (preferably distilled water)</p>
<p>1 tablespoon salt</p>
<p>Up to 20 drops essential oil</p>
<p>1-2 drops food coloring (optional)</p>
<p>Initially prepare your jars by adding a few drops of food coloring of your choice into each jar.</p>
<p>Next add 1 teaspoon of essential oil into each jar.&nbsp; If you desire a stronger scent you may want to add more drops of the essential oil however 1 teaspoon is usually sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Making the gel</strong></p>
<p>Boil 1 cup of water. Add the gelatine to the boiling water and whisk until dissolved.</p>
<p>After the gelatine dissolves, add the remaining cup of water and then the salt.</p>
<p>Once the salt has dissolved remove the pan from the heat and pour into the prepared jars. Pour the mixture into the jars within a few minutes of removing the pan off of the heat so that the gelatin does not set and make pouring difficult. It is advisable to wear oven gloves or use towels for your safety.</p>
<p>Allow the gel mixture to solidify at room temperature for 1 day. Place on a windowsill or other space in the toilet to fill the area with fresh aromas.</p>
<h2>Natural Toilet Poo Spray</h2>
<p>Poo sprays are handy at masking smells. Spray directly inside the toilet bowl after use. Poo sprays with natural ingredients are available to purchase in most health and online stores.</p>
<p>If you want to make your own here&rsquo;s the recipe:</p>
<p><strong>You will need</strong></p>
<p>Distilled water (you can use tap water however as it contains other minerals your recipe could be affected)</p>
<p>2 oz (or 4 oz) spray bottle</p>
<p>Up to 20 drops of Essential Oils</p>
<p>2 tablespoons of Rubbing Alcohol or Vodka</p>
<p><strong>Making the Poo Spray</strong></p>
<p>Add the drops of essential oils and 1 (or 2) tablespoons of rubbing alcohol in the spray bottle. The number of essential oil drops and your choice of essential oil is up to you. Experiment to find combinations you like best.</p>
<p>Shake the bottle to mix thoroughly. Add the water to the spray bottle to the top. Shake the bottle well in order to disperse all the ingredients.</p>
<p>You can use this after using the toilet. Simply spray up to 5 times on the toilet bowl this is very effective to add fragrance in the air without exposing yourself to harsh chemicals found in aerosols and diminish unwanted odor.</p>
<p>This pourri spray can be effectively used throughout your home. It is best to use in a fine misting spray bottle such as a perfume bottle. It is best to use amber glass spray bottles as essential oils break down and become less effective when exposed to light. If you cannot locate amber glass bottle simply cover and stick with paper around the bottles to reduce exposure to light.</p>
<p>You can make handy labels and stick them on the bottles of homemade pourri spray as instructions for your guests.</p>
