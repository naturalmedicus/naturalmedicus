<h2 id="description">What is Nicotine?</h2>
<p>Nicotine is a parasympathomimetic alkaloid, stimulant found in plants and vegetation belonging to the nightshade family. Nicotine is found in high amounts in good quality tobacco which is a common way most people boost their nicotine intake. However smoking is very addictive, a habit which is only mildly contributed by nicotine alone. There are many harmful chemicals found in cigarettes which are known to be carcinogenic. There are no relevant studies in humans on the carcinogenic effects of pure nicotine. Nicotine acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist which is why it is able to effect brain activity. It is chemically similar to a neurotransmitter acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Nicotine has some similar effects to caffeine and has been used historically in native tribes for ceremonial purposes.</p>
<p>Tobacco has thousands of other chemicals. Many of these are harmful as they are carcinogenic. There are also chemicals found in cigarettes which are known to be cardio toxic and teratogenic. Although tobacco is harmful to health and is one of the major preventable cause of death worldwide, some studies suggest the nicotine found in these plants may be helpful for various health conditions.</p>
<p>When dosed correctly nicotine may be a useful nootropic for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function.</p>
<p>Nicotine has been used as an insecticide in the past, however it has since been banned due to its toxic effects making it incredibly harmful to animals and humans.</p>
<p>Although tobacco is quite addictive some studies suggest that nicotine used on its own is less addictive. Nicotine is commonly used in NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) to help people who are chronic smokers to quit smoking.</p>
<h2 id="health-benefits">Health Benefits of Nicotine</h2>
<p>There have been many studies and researches in recent times for the potential benefits of Nicotine both as a nootropic and smart drug with ongoing research of its benefits for the treatment and prevention on neurological conditions such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. However there has not been enough research into the possible negative side effects of using nicotine. Despite this most studies are showing the potential positive outcomes of using nicotine.</p>
<h3>Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) to quit smoking</h3>
<p>NRT is a popular method to help chronic smokers quit the habit which is linked with lung cancer. This is done using vaporizers, transdermal patch, gums or lozenges which are considered to be safer alternatives to cigarette smoking. It is extremely effective at eliminating the risks associated with smoking.</p>
<h3>Focus and Concentration</h3>
<p>Nicotine is a stimulant similar to caffeine which helps with keeping the mind alert and focused and improving overall concentration. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC31902/">1</a>]</p>
<p>It also keeps the brain in a relaxed alpha state necessary for sharp focus and concentration. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19765621">2</a>]</p>
<h3>Nicotine can reduce ADHD symptoms</h3>
<p>Nicotine can reduce ADHD symptoms and improve attention span which makes it a safer alternative to other conventional medications which are likely to have negative side effects. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8741955">3</a>]</p>
<h3>Nicotine enhances memory and learning</h3>
<p>There are many studies and research revealing numerous benefits of nicotine for improving memory. One study suggests that this could be because nicotine increases the vasopressin hormone which has been linked with cognitive enhancement and is a popular nootropic for cognitive enhancement. Studies suggest that it can increase the speed with which the brain processes information. Nicotine can help with long term memory and memory consolidation which involves the transfer of short-term memory into long-term memory. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10497962">4</a>]</p>
<p>Nicotine also binds to several types of nicotinic receptors which affects the brain in specific ways. Some of which includes controlling attention, memory consolidation and motor function. Nicotine behaves the same way in the brain as acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that plays an important role in the brain for the formation of memories. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9227840">5</a>]</p>
<h3>Nicotine Boosts Creativity and Reduces Procrastination</h3>
<p>Nicotine helps the brain stay awake and alert and may help you to be more productive. This may be due to the relaxing alpha brain waves which nicotine induces.</p>
<p>Although there is not enough studies conducted on whether nicotine increases creativity there are some studies that reveals use of nicotine increases activity between the two hemispheres of the brain. Nicotine can increase alpha brain waves similar to L-theanine which may boost creativity. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2788071/">6</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4020761/">7</a>]. Nicotine increases certain neural activity between the two hemispheres of the brain creating a whole brain state. Some people use binaural beats to create a state in which both hemisphere of the brain are active. This combined activity may help with unleashing creative potential.</p>
<p>The relaxing effects of nicotine may also play a part in helping with creativity. Because of nicotine&rsquo;s effect on brain wave levels it has the potential to reduce stress and lower levels of stress means an even flow of mental state to prohibit feelings of procrastination.</p>
<h3>Nicotine can provide neuroprotection</h3>
<p>Some studies have shown resistance to the neuro-degenerative effects of toxins that closely resembled Parkinson&rsquo;s disease which indicates nicotine may have nuero protective effect on the brain. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11772120">8</a>]</p>
<h3>Nicotine can prevent and treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There are numerous studies showing potential for nicotine to help with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and Alzheimer&rsquo;s. These studies have found smokers to have less risk of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and Alzheimer&rsquo;s and many studies are also showing the benefits of nicotine for people with these conditions [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10942038">9</a>]. The risk of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and Alzheimer&rsquo;s in nonsmokers has generally been about twice that of smokers. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9303280">10</a>]</p>
<h3>Nicotine Reduces inflammation</h3>
<p>Some studies have shown that nicotine can reduce inflammation as it helps to block estrogen. Levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are linked with age related inflammation. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163205/">11</a>]</p>
<h3>Nicotine can help grow new blood vessels</h3>
<p>Nicotine may have some benefits for blood vessels. Nicotine can assist with the growth of new blood vessels and may help with treating circulation problems and conditions with circulation problems. [<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2001/07/nicotine-grows-new-blood-vessels">12</a>] [<a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/july11/nicotine.html">13</a>]</p>
<h3>Nicotine helps with depression</h3>
<p>There are some studies using a Nicotine patch showing a decrease in symptoms related to depression. Short term use of nicotine can have anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12151749">14</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC526783/">15</a>]</p>
<h3>Other health benefits of nicotine</h3>
<p>Nicotine can also provide protection against other conditions including those suffering from Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome, ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer and delay rheumatoid arthritis. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9336013">16</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0012974/">17</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22520577">18</a>][<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1951990">19</a>]</p>
<p>There are some benefits of growing tobacco in the garden as it acts as a natural repellent for some garden pests.</p>
<h2 id="agonist-synergist">Agonist / Synergist</h2>
<p>Nicotine acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist and is chemically similar to a neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Nicotinic agonists are chemicals or drugs that act similar to acetylcholine (Ach) at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHRs) which are receptor proteins that respond to acetylcholine. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have an affinity for nicotine which is why it includes the name &lsquo;nicotinic&rsquo;. &nbsp;nAChRs respond to nicotine as well as other nicotinic agonists which includes nicotine, acetylcholine, choline, cytisine, lobeline, epibatidine and varenicline</p>
<h2 id="antagonist">Antagonist</h2>
<p>Nicotinic antagonist. A nicotinic antagonist is a type of anticholinergic drug that inhibits the action of acetylcholine (ACh) at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Any drugs that inhibit the action of acetylcholine will also inhibit the action of nicotine. This includes nicotinic antagonists. Some nicotinic antagonists include Hexamethonium, Mecamylamine, Trimethaphan, Atracurium, Doxacurium, Mivacurium, Pancuronium, Tubocurarine, Vecuronium, Succinylcholine, 18-Methoxycoronaridine Dextromethorphan, Dextrorphan, 3-Methoxymorphinan. However many of these have mainly been used during surgery for muscle paralysis and are not readily available although mecamylamine and 18-methoxycoronaridine have been shown to block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and have the potential for treating drug addiction and also nicotine addiction. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10796584">20</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11085336">21</a>]</p>
<p>Bupropion an antidepressant drug has been shown to block the effects of nicotine. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10991997">22</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110698/">23</a>]</p>
<h2 id="food-sources">Food Sources of Nicotine</h2>
<p>Fruits, vegetables from the nightshade family contain various amounts of nicotine and mostly found in tobacco. Other nightshade contain only small amounts such as potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant as well as tobacco. Unripe green tomatoes contain higher amounts of nicotine however are unsafe to eat. However it is unsafe to eat unripe tomatoes in high amounts. Cauliflower also contains a small amount of nicotine.</p>
<p>Although fruits and vegetables from the nightshade family contain nicotine, you would need to consume a large amount to derive a substantial dose of nicotine. Tobacco is a high source of nicotine.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-daily-allowance">Recommended Daily Allowance</h2>
<p>There are no RDA for nicotine and it is not classed as essential.</p>
<h2 id="nicotine-supplementation">Nicotine Supplementation</h2>
<p>In recent times there have been many studies and research conducted into the potential health benefits of Nicotine. It is now becoming popular as a nootropic, however whilst there are many positive benefits unfortunately some negative side effects may ensue. It is recommended that for the purpose of using as a nootropic or for some of the numerous benefits to take only a small dose.</p>
<p>For example for people who are not smokers it would be drastic and potentionally dangerous to take a dose that might be suitable for a chronic smoker using NRT.</p>
<p>While there are many benefits of nicotine, when using as a nootropic or to relieve symptoms of certain conditions it is advisable to use low dose due to its potentially addictive nature.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people may choose to supplement with nicotine. It has been used as a nootropic for cognitive enhancement. Others also use it for dream enhancement as the nicotine absorbed during sleep suppress PGO waves which causes a person to retain waking awareness during the dream state. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nicotine is popularly used to quit smoking. The following are the various different methods of nicotine intake.</p>
<h3>Smoking cigarettes</h3>
<p>One of the most popular way people consume nicotine is through smoking. Cigarettes contain 8mg-20 mg of nicotine and most will be dependent on the quality of tobacco. CDC data shows that the smoker absorbs roughly 1mg of nicotine. [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/tobacco_industry/low_yield_cigarettes/">24</a>]</p>
<p>One benefit of smoking is that it contains anatabine another compound found in tobacco which has also been used in some anti-smoking supplements. Anatabine has anti-inflammatory properties and shows promise and can be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s. However because anatabine is commercially available, smoking is not necessary to obtain this compound. It is available under the brand name Anatabloc.</p>
<p>Smoking is well known to cause one of the most <strong>preventable cause of death</strong> throughout the world. Fortunately there are alternatives to consuming nicotine without the negative effects of smoking.</p>
<p>The following are alternative ways nicotine is absorbed without smoking and also used in NRT to help people quit the unhealthy habit of smoking:</p>
<h3>Nicotine Gums</h3>
<p>Most gums and chews contain 2-4mg per piece. It is recommended to not use more than 15 pieces in a day.</p>
<p>Chewing nicotine gum releases 2-4 mg and usually takes between 20-30 minutes. Addiction to nicotine gum is possible but rare. Unfortunately nicotine gum contains aspartame as well as other artificial sweeteners which with long term use could pose health risks.</p>
<h3>Nicotine Lozenges</h3>
<p>Nicotine lozenges are similar to nicotine gum in that they come in 2mg-4mg dose and also contain artificial sweeteners like aspartame as well as other ingredients that are unhealthy such as magnesium stearate. Nicorette mini-lozenges may be the safest product to use as it does not contain aspartame. However they do contain minimal amounts of other additives. It is possible to make homemade lozenges using pure e-liquid however may not be ideal as it poses risk of toxicity if it is incorrectly dosed.</p>
<h3>Nicotine Patches</h3>
<p>Nicotine patches come in higher doses with the highest being 21mg. These patches have a time-release formula that usually release nicotine over a 24 hour period.</p>
<p>Although nicotine patches contain more nicotine than the gum or lozenges do they are absorbed via the skin slowly throughout the day rather than all at once or shorter time.</p>
<p>Nicotine patches are expensive usually being the same price for the available doses and because of this some people may decide to cut the patches of higher dosed patches to save money. However it is usually labelled on the packaging to not cut the nicotine patches. The reason may be because it can alter the way the patch was designed to work which is to use a 24 hour time release. Although substances from the patch do not immediately flow out after cutting the patch, the dosage rate will no longer be effectively controlled. It is also possible that because of the cut edges this may cause the nicotine to evaporate.</p>
<p>You may also get too much nicotine from one part of the patch and very little from the other cut patch. However there is not enough research or information to suggest that cutting the patches can pose health issues. When in doubt it is best to follow manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. You could potentially overdose on nicotine or poison yourself using a cut patch or a high dose that may not be suitable for you.</p>
<p>Taking sudden high amounts of nicotine can make you feel sick especially if you are not a smoker.</p>
<p>A safe way to make the patch last longer is to keep the backing. Once you have used the patch for half the day rather than 24 hours or if you wish to not use it during sleeping simply place the patch on the backing and save to reapply the next day.</p>
<p>Another method is to remove half of the backing layer only, apply the patch to the skin. You can then cover over the whole patch with tape. The following day you can remove the patch and reapply using the other part covering the exposed part of the patch already used. However most patches come with aluminium backing and this may not feel comfortable.</p>
<p>You can talk to a pharmacist or doctor before trying this method or for any cutting methods that may be safe.</p>
<h3>Vaporizing and E-cigarettes</h3>
<p>The health effects of using vaporizing or E-cigarettes is unknown as use of it is fairly new.</p>
<p>There may be some concerns about nanoparticles of heavy metals from e-cigarettes combustion chambers which may be absorbed by inhalation. For some it may cause throat irritation however it may be beneficial for those trying to quit a chronic habit of smoking cigarettes to help break hold of the psychological factors of smoking, ie holding an e-cigarette.</p>
<h3>Nicotine spray</h3>
<p>Nicotine spray can provide up to 150 sprays with each spray providing 1mg of nicotine. There are other ingredients in the spray such as sucralose but the amounts are very minimal.</p>
<p>It is one of the easiest method to use and does not require chewing or sucking as lozenges do. This method can provide an instant fix whether you are using it for cognitive function or quit smoking. They are relatively expensive and each spray can contain as much as the highest dosed nicotine patch with the difference being the spray provides instant release whereas patches release over a long period of time.</p>
<h3>Nicotine inhalers</h3>
<p>Nicotine inhalers are just like sprays where they provide instant release of nicotine this is because inhaling it is absorbed by the lungs and readily effects the chemical changes in the brain. These will be most effective especially for smokers who are used to absorbing nicotine via inhalation. The benefits of using an inhaler is that there are no additional additives or chemicals that are usually found in other methods such as the spray and lozenges. However because it is being inhaled and the absorption rate instantly effecting brain chemicals you may find the nicotine content to be addictive.</p>
<h3>Liquid drops</h3>
<p>Liquid drops seems to be favored amongst nootropic users. It is simply using a pure nicotine base commonly used with e cigarettes however without the addition of flavors for those who want to make their own flavored e-liquids and apply very minimal drops on the skin. The e-liquid is available in different concentrations starting from 1.5mg/ml up to 36mg/ml. In the United Kingdom the legal limit for the sale of nicotine is 18mg. This delivery method may be a lot safer if dose is applied correctly which will need to be calculated and also more cost effective than any of the other methods. They usually come in dropper bottles with an approximation of nicotine per drop. <span style="color: #000000;">[<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3lvkmc/nicotine_as_nootropic_the_cheap_and_safe_way/">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>The method is to apply the correct amount of drops and massage into the skin. This has not been recommended for those trying to quit smoking and mostly used by those whose purpose is to use nicotine as a nootropic for enhancing cognitive function. There may be some risks associated with the use of liquid drops and caution should be used as it can easily be spilled and if absorbed can cause toxicity. This is a highly dangerous method and prone to risks which is why it cannot be recommended. If using this method it is best to buy a very low dosed concentration per ml of nicotine and avoid the higher range such as 18mg/ml, 24mg/ml which is too high.

<p>The following are some of the risks associated with nicotine:</p>
<p><strong>Nicotine can increase tumor growth</strong> &ndash; nicotine can increase capillary blood vessel growth which although positive in some situations especially blood circulation related conditions which is associated with those who have diabetes, this can also lead to the growth of tumor which can further lead to the growth of certain forms of cancer such as lung cancers. Cancer from tobacco carcinogens are a common factor. If you have cancer it is best to avoid nicotine.</p>
<p>Nicotine can increase tumor growth in colon, pancreas, breast, and larynx. Tobacco may be a much greater culprit in the growth of these types of tumors and cancer growth due to its high levels of numerous carcinogens. However, nicotine is not classed as a carcinogen.</p>
<p><strong>Low prefrontal cortex in adolescent user</strong> &ndash; teenagers and young adults up to the age of 25 should refrain from use of nicotine as it can impair the growth of the prefrontal cortex which can cause risk of cognitive impairment in the growing brain. In addition to this young users are likely to develop mental and behavioral problems later in life which includes depression, agoraphobia, panic disorder and personality disorders.

However NRT therapy in this case may help to curb the habit. Those who have a tendency addiction or an addictive personality may want to avoid nicotine and use a safer alternative such as L-theanine.</p>

<p><strong>Quitting nicotine can cause undesired withdrawal symptoms</strong> &ndash; building a tolerance to nicotine and then suddenly quitting can cause several withdrawal problems. This can make quitting nicotine difficult. Quitting nicotine as in the case for many smokers may cause strong cravings for the substance which includes increased appetite, anxiety, anger, frustration, depression, irritability, restlessness, sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal problems,. Unlike L-theanine, nicotine is not a direct sedative or a relaxant with some studies showing that the relaxing and calming effect is due to relieving the symptoms of withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>Nicotine Increases Risk of H pylori infection</strong> &ndash; H. pylori infection seems to be common in smokers. It is best to avoid nicotine by people who suffer from H pylori infection as nicotine can make eradicating the infection less effective. Nicotine has shown to increase toxic activity in the stomach with those who suffer from H. pylori infection in the stomach</p>
