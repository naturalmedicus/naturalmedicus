<h2 id="description">What is Dopamine?</h2>
<p>Dopamine also known as 3,4 Dihydroxyphenethylamine (DA) is an excitatory neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator. Dopamine is categorized in the monoamine group of neurotransmitters with the others being norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline) and acetylcholine. </p>
<p>Dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are monoamine neurotransmitters, also categorised as catecholamines. These neurotransmitters are released in minute amounts from the brain and peripheral nervous system. They play an important role in arousal, emotion, and cognition. </p>
<p>Dopamine is similar to acetylcholine which is another monoamine neurotransmitter and also needed for memory, learning, attention, cognition, motivation and arousal. Any impairment in these functions can also be a sign of low dopamine instead of acetylcholine which can likely be determined through directly raising levels of either dopamine or acetylcholine. Only small amounts of acetylcholine is needed to activate dopamine. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4398814/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Dopamine is known as the pleasure neurotransmitter as it increases feelings of pleasure and involved in reward and punishment activity in the brain. However it has many other functions and interactions within the body. Much like acetylcholine which is needed in small amounts to activate the release of dopamine, this neurotransmitter is involved in movement and motivation. It is also involved in addiction as people repeat behaviours that stimulate dopamine release and usually triggered by pleasurable activities which includes food, sex, and drugs. </p>
<p>This dopamine release is mostly found in areas such as the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. </p>
<p>The adrenals are important glands involved in producing dopamine and also other neurotransmitters that act like hormones such as epinephrine (adrenaline). </p>
<p>Neurons generate either excitatory or inhibitory nerve impulses with some neurotransmitters being able to function as both excitatory and inhibitory. </p>
<p>In the brain dopamine is produced in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and hypothalamus. </p>
<p>Dopamine is also produced in the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately fifty per cent of dopamine is synthesised in the gastrointestinal tract by enteric neurons and intestinal epithelial cells which contributes to higher level of dopamine in hepatic portal vein. The hepatic portal vein is a blood vessel that carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas and spleen to the liver. </p>
<p>Within the brain dopamine is produced in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Dopamine is released by the hypothalamus. [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536995/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p> 
<p>Dopamine can be found throughout the body which includes the brain, immune system, kidneys and pancreas. </p>
<p>L-DOPA which is the precursor for dopamine is synthesized in the brain and kidneys </p>
<p>Dopamine is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and dopamine synthesis occurs in the area it is being used such as the brain, kidneys and other organs and systems. </p>
<p>The production of dopamine and its functions in peripheral areas does not depend on the production and functions of dopamine within the brain. </p>
<p>Dopamine functions in different parts of the peripheral nervous system. It has a specific function depending on the location of dopamine synthesis which can be found in blood vessels, kidneys, pancreas, digestive system and immune system. </p>

<p>Dopamine has 5 types of receptors and when activated each receptor has a specific function. These receptors are known as D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538242/" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>D1 Receptors are the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system which ‘prepare’ the set of possible responses with the D2 receptors then activated to ‘shape’ and ‘select’ the final response from this initial response set framework. </p>
<p>Not only is the dopamine neurotransmitter involved in movement, learning, attention, sleep, mood, emotions but also plays a role in pain processing as shown in studies on D2 receptors and its involvement with pain. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22902996/" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
Dopamine is one of the main neurotransmitters in our reward system and reinforces activities that increase feelings of joy which increases the feeling of wanting more of what feels good. </p>
<p>Dopamine plays an important role in the dopaminergic pathway (also known as the mesolimbic pathway or reward pathway) and influences the reward and punishment activity within the brain. </p>
<p>Dopamine plays an important role in many bodily functions such as increased heart rate and blood pressure control. Dopamine release helps increase focus levels and motivation.
[<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3046107/" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>Dopamine can provide bursts of energy and is involved with glutamate release another excitatory neurotransmitter essential for production of inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. </p>
<p>Dopamine and norepinephrine release in the frontal cortex as well as acetylcholine, another neurotransmitter which is involved in release of dopamine.</p> 


<h2 id="health-benefits">Health Benefits of Dopamine</h2>

<h3>Supports movement and coordination</h3>
<p>Dopamine is needed for the control of motor function and voluntary movement. Like acetylcholine it helps regulate coordination and muscle movements. </p>
<p>Deficiency is linked to various conditions that affect movement such as Parkinson’s disease which is characterized by tremors. [<a href =" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068871/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<h3>Increases motivation</h3>
<p>Dopamine is the main neurotransmitter involved in motivation and increases the drive to seek rewards and achieve goals. This neurotransmitter is associated with achievement and motivational salience. </p>
<p>Dopamine can help with making the effort needed to be successful through its role in reward and achievement. A deficiency of dopamine is linked to procrastination. </p>
<h3>Supports cognitive functions</h3>
<p>Dopamine is needed for various cognitive functions being produced in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental regions of the brain. </p>
<p>It plays an important role in cognitive functions such as working memory, learning, problem solving and control of attention. </p>
<p>Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex modulates cognitive control which influences memory. Dopamine is involved in the integration of thoughts and emotions. </p>
<p>Dopamine controls the flow of information from other areas of the brain which is needed for problem solving. In the cerebral cortex the frontal lobe contains the highest amounts of dopamine neurons. Dopamine limits and selects sensory information arriving from the thalamus to the forebrain. </p>
<p>High dopamine levels increases alertness, creativity, long-term memory and concentration which improves ability to focus and learn. </p>
<p>Changes in dopamine neurotransmission is implicated in cognitive control with too little causing decline in cognitive functions and too much causing racing thoughts and issues with impulse control.
[<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9915705/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9347483/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2167690/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1712279/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<h3>Improves mood</h3>
<p>Dopamine can boost mood in a variety of situations whether it is in relationships or partaking in an enjoyable activity. </p> 
<p>Dopamine is involved in pleasurable reward and this can be seen when a person finds a pleasurable activity and register this to repeat in the future for the same feeling of pleasure. Meditation is associated to the blissful state and can increase dopamine levels which may help balance mood. </p>
<p>Dopamine is also involved in the neurochemistry of feeling love and attachment. </p>
<p>People in love have an increase in dopamine and this release of dopamine can increase feelings of attachment as couples feel happy to be in the presence of their partner which again plays on the reward pleasure system. </p>
<p>Dopamine, is one of the four main neurotransmitters that is responsible for the feelings of wellbeing and happiness. The other neurotransmitters include serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins. </p>
<p>These are all needed in a specific balance for these benefits on mental wellbeing and can be increased naturally through healthy diets, adequate exercise and partaking in fun activities such as dance, music and other enjoyable activities. </p>
<p>Low or insufficient levels of dopamine and its precursor phenylalanine and tyrosine has shown to cause an increase in anxiety levels and low mood which can lead to depression. </p>
<p>Dopamine is also needed for the synthesis of norepinephrine which helps improve symptoms of depression. </p>
<p>The D1 receptor help mediate some behavioural responses. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor mechanisms are involved in mediating anxiety. </p>
<h3>Supports sleep wake cycle</h3>
<p>Dopamine is involved in the circadian rhythm from its actions in the pineal gland which regulates the sleep wake cycle. Dopamine is needed for wakefulness and involved in concentration and focus that is needed throughout the day. </p>
<p>Although dopamine functions are excitatory it also plays a role in sleep. Dopamine is the precursor for norepinephrine which is needed for the synthesis and release of melatonin in the pineal gland during sleep. [<a href ="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/773506" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>In circadian rhythms dopamine is highest at around 7am and has shown to decrease throughout the day and decreases to the lowest level by 3 pm. </p>
<p>The amino acid phenylalanine is also one of the ultraviolet light absorbing amino acids needed for dopamine synthesis. </p>
<p>Beta brainwaves help release dopamine and this brain wave pattern is present when we are alert, awake and actively focused. </p>
<p>Some studies have shown that lack of sleep can decrease certain dopamine receptors however others are showing an increase of dopamine in certain brain areas implying that lack of sleep can cause an imbalance of dopamine. [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3026477/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<h3>Involved in positive behaviour</h3>
<p>Dopamine increases a sense of altruism which is positive in a social situation or within the community. </p>
<p>Dopamine is linked to altruism where a person will help others out of a selfless sense of care without any hidden motives. Altruistic people do however receive the benefit of a release of dopamine and other feel good neurotransmitter and neurohormones such as oxytocin and serotonin. Those with a sense of altruism are often accompanied by a release of dopamine after having met a need. It feels good to make others feel good. </p>
<p> Dopamine is implicated in social behaviour. Optimal dopamine levels reduces anxiety, increases wellbeing and allows a person to cope in stressful situations. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14551436/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<h3>Supports hormones </h3>
<p> Dopamine interacts with the hormone system and has shown to increase when hormones such as estrogen and testosterone also increase. It plays a role in the brains of both men and women. </p>
<p>The hypothalamus gland regulates the release of hormones and is also a part of the brain where dopamine is produced. Hormones are transported to the pituitary gland and then to the different organs of the body. </p>
<p> Dopamine levels are increased by estradiol, a form of the dominant female hormone estrogen observed in the pre-ovulatory phase of the female monthly cycle (menstrual cycle) when estrogen levels peak [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508121/" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p> Other studies on rats has also shown an association of dopamine increase with estrogen. Estrogen has also shown to play a role in cognition and may be why some women have better cognitive abilities with the rise of estrogen at specific phases of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p> [<a href ="" target="_blank">R</a>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15936760/] [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21881567/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<h3>Supports release of other neurotransmitters</h3>
<p>Virtually all neurotransmitters discovered work in concert with each other, all of which are required in adequate amount for various important functions throughout the brain and body. Too much or too little can cause an excess or insufficient levels of other neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Dopamine follows the catecholamine pathway and is needed for the synthesis of other neurotransmitters following same pathway which include norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Although dopamine converts to norepinephrine, when dopamine is the dominant neurotransmitter it inhibits release of norepinephrine which is linked to stressful situations and activates the fight or flight function. When norepinephrine is suppressed, the dopamine in blood vessels acts as a vasodilator which helps with relaxation. </p>
<p>D1 receptors regulate neuronal growth and development which are important for neurotransmission. </p>
<h3>Involved in appetite and thirst</h3>
<p>Dopamine is involved in appetite and appetite control and having the right level is important for healthy bodily functions. </p>
<p>Dopamine functions in the pancreas by reducing insulin production which increases food intake. </p>
<p>When insulin levels reduce, the blood glucose cannot enter the cells to produce energy and as a result this can increase food intake particularly high carbohydrate foods and may impact serotonin levels. </p>
<p>Reduced levels of dopamine increases hunger with cravings associated with tyrosine rich food such as cheese and chocolate. Serotonin can suppress hunger.</p>
<p>Dopamine increases ghrelin which increases hunger.
[<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19523165/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p> 
<p>In the kidneys dopamine functions include increasing sodium and urine excretion. Some studies on mice have shown that thirst and the reward associated when the thirst is quenched with either plain water or saline water is associated with the release of dopamine and is likely to be connected to dopamine’s functions in the kidneys. </p>
<h3>Needed for Digestive health</h3>
<p>Dopamine is important for the digestive system where most of it is produced in the gastrointestinal tract. Dopamine reduces gastrointestinal motility, protects intestinal mucosa and protects against peptic ulcer (gastroduodenal ulcer disease). [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5772764/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7312307/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2882049/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<h3>Supports the immune system</h3>
<p>Dopamine in the immune system is linked to reduced activity of lymphocytes. Dopamine is able to decrease inflammation and can help support the immune system in this way. </p>
<p>The dopaminergic system is involved in autoimmune diseases. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3968755/" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<h3>Reduces alcohol withdrawal symptoms and may benefit addictive behaviour</h3>
<p>Phenylalanine supplementation may be useful for alcohol withdrawal as it may balance mood and reduce withdrawal symptoms. Alcoholism is an addictive behaviour and may use up dopamine levels causing the alcoholic to reach out for another drink to soothe the mind. Many addictive behaviours are linked to dopamine receptors in the brain. The constant seeking of fulfilment found in addictive behaviour may use up dopamine levels causing a deficiency. </p>
<p>Small amounts of alcohol can increase dopamine and it’s rewarding effects which in turn can pave the way for addiction. </p>
<p>Replenishing dopamine levels and keeping the catecholamines pathway strong as well as having nutrients that support MAO production which help to deactivate these neurotransmitters so that too much of it is not circulating may help benefit all kinds of addictive behaviour. Some rehabilitation programs may use tyrosine to help people with drug addiction. </p>
<p>Although dopamine is involved in addiction it has more functions besides increasing pleasure and acts in various ways in the brains reward system. </p>
<p>The effects of dopamine is dependent on the pathway it is being operated in the brain. </p>
<p> [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905114/" target="_blank">R</a>] 
[<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15704345/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<h3>Supports lactation</h3>
<p>The tuberoinfundibular pathway which is a dopamine pathway in the brain supports breast milk production which is important for nursing mothers breastfeeding. The dopamine release in this pathway regulates release of the hormone prolactin by pituitary gland which stimulates the production of breast milk. However, prolactin rises when dopamine levels are reduced whilst higher levels of dopamine will inhibit the release of prolactin. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32627906/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Some antipsychotic medications used in cases of schizophrenia alters the dopamine system and can cause lactation as a side effect which can also occur in men.</p>

<img src="http://www.naturalmedicus.com/images/nutrition-images/nt-images/dopamine.png" alt="dopamine synthesis">


<p>Tyrosine is converted to dopamine once it reaches the neurons and continues along the catecholamines pathway to synthesise norepinephrine. </p>
<p>Phenylalanine to Dopamine Synthesis</p>
<p>Vitamin B3 (NADH is the form of vitamin B3 needed), BH4 (tetrahydrobioptrin) a form of vitamin B9, Fe is needed to help convert phenylalanine to Tyrosine. This conversion requires phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme. Tyrosine metabolism also needs NADH and BH4. Tyrosine needs these nutrients and vitamin B9 for conversion to L. Dopa which requires tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme. Tyrosine may also be directly ingested from food. Dopa decarboxylase enzyme or aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase needs P5P (active form of vitamin B6) to convert L. Dopa to dopamine. The pathway continues to norepinephrine and epinephrine pathway of catecholamines. </p>
<p>DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) is needed for the synthesis of dopamine from L-DOPA and serotonin from L-5-hydroxytryptophan. </p>
<p>DDC catalyzes the conversion of aromatic amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine into their corresponding amines dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine and serotonin. </p> 
<p>Tyrosine needs both vitamin C and calcium for its utilisation. </p>

<p>Dopamine to Norepinephrine Synthesis</p>
<p>Dopamine needs dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) enzyme and cofactors calcium, copper and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) for conversion to norepinephrine. </p> 
<p>Vitamin C is one of the main vitamins needed for healthy adrenal glands where this vitamin is also found in high concentrations. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15666839/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>The enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase can be found in the adrenals and the brain as well as being present in other organs such as the heart. [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614808/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Copper is needed by enzymes that control dopamine. </p>
<p>DBH needs copper to synthesize the neurotransmitter norepinephrine from dopamine. </p>
<p>Dopamine beta hydroxylase also needs calcium as well as ascorbic acid in order to convert to norepinephrine which helps to improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression. [<a href =" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC389390/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Adequate amounts of copper is needed for the functions of the brain. It is an essential mineral in the growth and development of the brain. Having too little or too much of this mineral can lead to a decline of cognitive functions and has been linked to neurological disorders such as such as Menke’s disease, Wilson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24440710/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336199/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>

<a href ="" target="_blank">R</a>
<p>Norepinephrine to Epinephrine Synthesis</p>
<p>Norepinephrine requires Phenylethanolamine – N-methyltransferase enzyme and cofactors SAMe, Mg and Cortisol. SAMe (S-Adenosyl-l-methionine) cofactors needed for synthesis include vitamin B9, B12 and methionine. </p>
<p>SAMe (s-adenylsylmethionine) is made from the essential amino acid methionine. </p>  
<p>Acetylcholine has some influence over methionine production. </p>
<p>Methionine plays an important role in the dopamine or catecholamines pathway. </p>
<p>Methionine is a building block for the neurotransmitter epinephrine (adrenaline) and donates a methyl group (-CH3) to norepinephrine (noradrenaline) for epinephrine production. </p>
<p>Epinephrine is an excitatory neurotransmitter produced when stressed or excited. It activates fight or flight mode within the body characterized by increased heart rate, blood flow and bood pressure and releasing a boost of energy. Stress can impair adrenal function and also deplete methionine. Methionine also controls the adrenal glands. 
<p>The catecholamines need beta brainwaves which promote dopamine release. </p>
<p>Both phenylalanine and tyrosine can cross the blood brain barrier. </p>
<p>Phenylalanine or tyrosine are more likely to be beneficial if taken on an empty stomach to avoid competition from other amino acids to cross the blood brain barrier. </p>
<p>The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase at the pre-synaptic nerve ending is essential in the synthesis of norepinephrine and needs electrical activity along the nerve to increase amount of this enzyme. </p>
<p>Tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme, increases with the sense of touch around the body and helps to synthesise norepinephrine. </p>
<p>The sense of touch at any particular point on the body can transmit nerve impulses to the brain. Caressing or therapies dealing with touch such as massage, chiropractic or osteopathy may increase the amount of electrical nerve impulses. </p>
<p>Dopamine is released when endorphins bind to receptors of the central nervous system. </p>
<p>Folate (natural active form of vitamin B9) regulates tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4 or THB) levels. </p> 
<p>BH4 plays a vital role in cognitive functions and is needed by enzymes in the body that help with dopamine and serotonin synthesis. BH4 is also used by enzymes nitric oxide synthases (NOS) that help to form nitric oxide (NO). It is also an essential cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. </p>
<p>Folate deficiency can decrease BH4 levels which will reduce synthesis of dopamine and serotonin.
[<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2522108" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>Nutrients that support BH4 levels include folate or the supplement Methylfolate (MTHF), Curcumin and vitamin C. </p>
<p>Methyl folate prevents oxidation of BH4 into BH2. Ensuring adequate supply of NOS enzymes will also help prevent breakdown of BH4. </p>
<p>Bioidentical hormone therapy may help with deficiency associated with low estrogen and testosterone as these work in tandem with the neurotransmitter dopamine. </p>
<p>Sunlight exposure helps raise vitamin D3 levels which is needed for optimal levels of dopamine release. </p>
<p>Cofactors for hormones such as testosterone may increase dopamine. </p>
<p>Phenylalanine is a precursor to neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. </p>
<p>Tyrosine which can be synthesised from phenylalanine or obtained directly from food source converts to dopamine and needs sufficient amounts of biopterin, vitamin B3, copper and vitamin C for conversion. </p> 
<p>DL-phenylalanine has been used for chronic depression and may improve mood and this is directly from its conversion into tyrosine and then into norepinephrine. It is an important component of the catecholamines synthesis and also needed for dopamine production which helps with focus and uplifting mood.  Tyrosine is also useful for anxiety. </p>
<p>Phenylethylamine or PEA is another natural derivative of phenylalanine produced in the body which can cause feelings of euphoria, runners high, and even involved in the feeling of falling in love. This derivative acts like a natural amphetamine. PEA increases the release of dopamine and serotonin, two very important neurotransmitters associated with positive mood. It is also involved in the release of norepinephrine. </p>
<p>Phenylethylamine is found in chocolate and cheese however rapidly breaks down with digestion before it can reach the brain. </p>
<p>Inositol (Vitamin B8) works with choline which when combine form lecithin, an essential component for cell membranes which protect cells from oxidation and protect the myelin sheath. This is important for regulating nerve transmissions. </p>
<p>Many studies are showing potential benefits of inositol on mental health conditions such as anxiety, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder ADHD. Reports of inositol use reveal an increased levels of energy and improved memory, mental alertness and concentration. It has also shown to be helpful with treating anxiety. </p>
<p>Inositol can help regulate mood through its involvement in the manufacturing of serotonin, melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and GABA. These neurotransmitters require inositol for transmitting messages between the brain cells. A deficiency of inositol has been linked to various mental health problems which includes depression, anxiety and panic attacks where many of the neurotransmitters are out of balance. </p>
<p>Vitamin D has role in regulating various hormones and neurotransmitters essential for brain health and preventing depression. These include adrenaline, epinephrine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), dopamine and serotonin. The adrenal gland regulates tyrosine hydroxylase which is the rate limiting enzyme involved in the production of neurotransmitters which is achieved by the gland with activated vitamin D. A deficiency of vitamin D can lead to depression and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). </p>
<p>Vitamin A is also necessary for neurotransmitters and their functions. The body converts vitamin A into retinoic acid, which is involved in gene transcription which promotes the production of enzymes involved in synthesising neurotransmitters such as dopamine. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC24972/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075211/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Vitamin A and vitamin D nuclear receptors bind together in a genetic regulatory mechanism [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2906676/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Vitamin A and vitamin D are both also important for utilizing calcium and needed in sufficient amounts for a healthy immune system. </p>
<p> [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9884583/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p> Iodine along with selenium plays a very important role in the thyroid by supporting and maintaining its functions in the body. Iodine is needed for T4 and T3 production. In the brain these hormones are needed to activate neurotransmitters acetylcholine and others such as dopamine, norepinepherine, serotonin and GABA. Deficiency in iodine is linked to poor cognitive functions and intellectual disability. </p>
<p> Tyrosine is also important for thyroid function and combines with iodine to form the thyroid hormones T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine). </p>
<p> A deficiency in thyroid hormones T4 and T3 can lead to problems with cognition, memory, focus, concentration, sleep, mood and recall. </p>
<p> T4 and T3 hormones regulate gene expression by switching the genes on or off. The genes are needed to regulate neurotransmitters that regulate mood. </p>
<p> Vitamin B12 is a cofactor needed for the production of dopamine and other neurotransmitters which includes, norepinephrine, GABA and serotonin. </p>
<p> B12 deficiency also has an impact on mood, emotions and sleep which can contribute to psychiatric disorders. </p>
<p> B12 deficiency is linked to neurological conditions such as epilepsy, cognitive decline, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and dementia. </p>
<p> Some parts of the brain needed for cognitive functions such as memory and learning are affected by folate deficiency. Additionally high homocysteine levels have been associated with neurological disorders which can also be an indicator for low levels of B12 and other deficiencies such as B6 and B9. </p>
<p>Deficiency of B12 can cause oxidative damage to brain cells leading to cognitive decline. In addition to B12, vitamin B9 is also needed to help the nerves function properly. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22221769" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4723262/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Many of the B-complex vitamins also play an important role in keeping the nervous system healthy and the brain functioning properly. </p>
<p>Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause high homocysteine which is also linked to neurodegenerative disorders and can cause damage to the myelin sheath of the neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) helps regulate levels of glutamate and dopamine. NAC is a precursor of glutathione. High levels of glutamate can cause death of brain cells. NAC protects dopamine receptors which can help dopamine function. </p>
<p>NAC can protect dopaminergic nerve terminals from chronic methamphetamine use. </p>
<p>Probiotics are live microorganisms found in the lining of the digestive tract and can help synthesise dopamine. Probiotic strains involved in the synthesis of dopamine include Escherichia, Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacillus species. </p>
<p>L. plantarum increases dopamine and serotonin. </p>
<p>CBD can stimulate the release of glutamate and dopamine by stimulating adenosine receptor. CBD interacts with the dopamine receptors which stimulates dopamine release. </p>
<p>Essential fatty acids (EFA) are required for brain health and its functions. </p>
<p>The brain is mostly composed of fat (lipids) which are needed for healthy brain cells and neurotransmission. EFAs alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) are needed for cell membranes of neurons. </p>
<p>Omega 3 fatty acids can increase dopamine levels and D2 receptor binding. Omega 3 also reduces monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activity in the prefrontal cortex and D2 receptor binding in the striatum. 
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3956108/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Saturated fat intake can prevent dopamine production. Taking an equal amount or more monounsaturated fats than saturated fats may prevent dopamine from decreasing. [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34184629/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href=" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4707827/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Reducing neurotransmitter acetylcholine has shown to increase dopamine activity. </p>
<p>Oregano oil may raise dopamine and estrogen levels. </p>
<p>Some research is showing a link between the hormone estrogen and dopamine. Estrogen stimulates release of dopamine. Estrogen is involved in cognition and fluctuating levels directly affect cognitive functions in women across the monthly menstrual cycles. Research suggests that when estrogen levels are adequate and functioning this improves cognitive functions in women. </p>
<p>Estradiol (Estrogen) levels peak in the pre-ovulatory phase and studies have been down to show that dopamine levels also increase with estrogen increase. </p>
<p>Research is also showing the death of dopamine cells in the brain may occur when estrogen is significantly low and is likely to occur in post menopause in women. </p>
<p>Estrogen functions throughout the body and especially in the brain areas that control emotions. </p>
<p>Estrogen increases serotonin and the number of serotonin receptors in the brain which when activated increase endorphins in the brain that can help with improved mood. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4793919/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20079719/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Testosterone increases release of dopamine this may be more evident in men as testosterone is the predominant male based hormone. </p>
<p>Dopamine has some influence on the altered release of prolactin, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1369597/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>In women Luteinizing Hormone (LH) stimulates release of estradiol (estrogen) during ovulation. Progesterone levels rise after ovulation from the ovaries. Dopamine levels rise along with estradiol. Follicular Stimulating Hormone (FSH) also rises along with LH. </p>
<p>In men LH stimulates testosterone release in the testes. </p>
<p>Progesterone and allopregnanolone interacts with dopaminergic system. [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22458414/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17535560/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Progesterone can help release dopamine only if there has been a previous exposure to estrogen. This is likely to occur in the luteal phase for women when progesterone is significantly peaking. </p>
<p>Caffeine which is found in high amounts in coffee can help release dopamine but may be counterintuitive as it can also have antagonistic effects. </p>
<p>Caffeine can take around six hours to leave the body. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/" target="_blank">R</a>] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805807/] </p>
<p>Essential oils (listed above) help to balance the dopaminergic system. </p>
<p>Essential oils can help raise various neurotransmitters through inhalation which sends signals to the olfactory system stimulating the brain to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. Different essential oils result in specific type of neurotransmitter release. </p>
<p>Exercise may help dopamine levels as it increases hormones that also increase along with the neurotransmitter. </p>
<p>Cold showers may increase dopamine levels [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/911386/] </p>
<p>Epinephrine release may be stimulated by essential oils of jasmine, rose, black pepper and grapefruit. </p>
<p>To balance effects of norepinephrine and or epinephrine using essential oils that promote relaxation may be beneficial. Vetiver, frankincense, and lavender can improve sleep, reduce anxiety, lower heart rate and blood pressure and may have anti-inflammatory effects. </p>
<p>Using essential oils that also help boost estrogen levels can also be helpful during the second part of the follicular phase when estrogen levels rise and is the best time for raising estrogen. Adequate nutritional cofactors for estrogen production around this time may also be beneficial. The essential oils that may raise estrogen include lavender, oregano, thyme, tea tree, geranium, clary sage and patchouli. Some essential oils also help balance out estrogen if levels are too high. </p>
<p>Essential oils that may increase testosterone include fennel essential oil, cinnamon, rosemary, roman chamomile, ylang ylang, clary sage, lavender, rose geranium, rose otto, and frankincense. </p>
<p>For optimal neurotransmitter and overall health it is important to get sufficient and quality sleep and synchronizing with a healthy circadian rhythm can ensure that the appropriate neurotransmitters are releasing at appropriate times of the day. </p> 
<p>Some essential oils along with sleep hygiene are helpful for sleep which include lavender, passion flower, roman chamomile, and vetiver essential oils. </p>
<p>Practices and techniques that help reduce from intense physical and psychological stress can support dopamine as well as the functioning of other neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Meditation, positive thinking, writing a gratitude list, focusing on happy memories and activities may help boost a positive mood associated with dopamine. </p>
<p>Goal oriented checklists with an aim of goal setting can help stay focused and act as a navigator for when dopamine is activated. </p>
<p>Having a spiritual connection can make some people feel positive and optimistic. </p>
<p>Essential oils may trigger memories. When using essential oils with dopamine boosting activities or practices with dopamine boosting essential oils this can help form new habits that are linked to dopamine. </p>
<p>Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a copper-containing enzyme which deactivates the catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine) after their function has ended which reduces dopamine levels. MAO inhibitors inhibit the action of this enzyme and thereby prevents breakdown of dopamine which allows the brain to utilise this neurotransmitter. </p>
<p>L-theanine is an amino acid found in green tea helps with relaxation and is used as a nootropic with caffeine to avoid the jittery and anxiety effects of caffeine intake. </p>
<p>Nicotine increases acetylcholine which helps with dopamine release. </p>
<p>Sugar intake should be decreased or limited to prevent excess dopamine. Chromium has shown to reduce sugar cravings.

<h2 id="food-sources">Food Sources of Dopamine</h2>
<p>A diet with adequate protein and other essential nutrients are needed to help maintain dopamine levels. It is important to get sufficient levels of the amino acid phenylalanine and tyrosine. </p>
<p>Phenylalanine can be found in most high protein food and some plant based food source. It is more abundant in animal based food than in plant based food source. Animal based food source include beef, chicken, fish (herring), dairy products such as cheese, egg, cottage cheese and chocolate. Plant based food source include almonds, peanuts apple, avocado, baked beans, soya bean, soy proteins, banana beet, carrot, parsley, pineapple, spinach, tomato.</p>
<p>Mammalian breast milk contains phenylalanine. </p>
<p>Tyrosine which is derived from phenylalanine can also be found in food. Animal protein contain the highest amount of tyrosine. </p>
<p>Animal food source of tyrosine are similar to phenylalanine source and includes beef, pork, turkey, duck, chicken, fish, eggs, yoghurt, cottage cheese, cheese and milk. </p>
<p>Wild meat such as game and venison contain higher amounts of tyrosine. </p>
<p>Plant based tyrosine food source includes almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, peanuts, soya bean, soy proteins, soya products, chocolate, apples, apricot, asparagus, avocado, baked beans, legumes, capsicum, carrots, spinach, alfalfa, beet, lettuce, parsley, watercress, leek, cucumber, banana, strawberries, cherries, fig and watermelon. </p>
<p>There is too little tyrosine in most plant based foods such as cereals, grains, fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p>Phenylethylamine can be found in chocolate and cheese but is unable to reach the brain due to breaking up quickly through digestion. </p>
<p>Aspartame contains phenylalanine. Aspartame is an artificial sweetener found as replacement to sugar in some sugar free sodas and foods as well as some medications. However this may not be a beneficial source of phenylalanine as various studies have linked high amounts to certain health problems. </p>
<p>It is important to eat high protein foods to ensure adequate dopamine production. </p> 
<p>Eating a diet with adequate cofactor nutrients is also necessary to support dopamine synthesis. </p>
<p>Other foods that may increase dopamine include green leafy vegetables, green tea, lima beans, oatmeal and wheatgerm. </p>
<p>To keep the catecholamines pathway strong and healthy it is also important to get sufficient levels of methionine. </p>
<p>Food intake of iron and zinc is also needed to help with synthesis of dopamine. </p>
<p>Food intake of vitamin B3, vitamin B6, vitamin B9, B-complex and vitamin C are water soluble and must be replenished daily. </p>

<h2 id="recommended-daily-allowance">Recommended Daily Allowance</h2>
<p>There are no set amounts of recommended neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter synthesis depend on the nutrients obtained from the diet or supplementation. Brainwave frequencies and other practices such as meditation can also effect levels of neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are made from protein and amino acids. They also need other cofactors such as vitamins and minerals for synthesis. </p>
<p>Dietary protein is therefore essential and getting adequate, sufficient supply of all nutrients in the correct balance is essential. </p>
<p>A healthy adult needs between 40 and 70 grams of daily protein intake. This can go up to as much as 90 grams for active and athletic people. </p>
<p>Diet and nutritional supplementation can be tweaked to meet the requirement of necessary nutrients and ensuring adequate levels of neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters operate at different times of the day and are largely dictated by light exposure. Serotonin and dopamine are produced mostly during daylight hours. During dark hours the serotonin converts to melatonin and more GABA is present. </p>
<p>Brainwaves also correspond with the different neurotransmitters. In the morning the brain has alpha waves which increase to beta waves throughout the day. Gamma waves may also facilitate the daylight hours and ideal for higher learning. The alpha and beta waves facilitate acetylcholine and dopamine. </p>
<p>Other factors such as the seasons and a woman’s monthly menstrual cycle can also determine the amount of specific neurotransmitters needed and at which point of the cycle. For example in the luteal phase GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter as this part of the phase we see a spike in the hormone progesterone which works synergistically with this calming neurotransmitter. Serotonin will also be present at this time as well as more conversion into melatonin to facilitate sleep. </p>
<p>Dopamine will be more available during the follicular phase which seems to increase with the rise of the female reproductive hormone estrogen. </p>
<p>In northern climates during winter with the lack of sunlight there is likely to be a lower production of serotonin or higher amounts of this may convert to melatonin possibly through daylight hours shortening. This may pick up slightly as spring emerges. Many people also find that spring makes them feel motivated. </p>
<p>Everyone is unique and a person’s life experience may dictate more of what neurotransmitter may be required on any given day. An example is a highly stressed person is very likely to be needing more serotonin and dopamine and possibly other neurotransmitters as the chronic stress quickly depletes all neurotransmitters and can lead to a state of depression. </p>
<p>Checking deficiency levels of neurotransmitters can help determine what may be needed along with using brainwave measuring device which uses electroencephalography (EEG) may help identify the neurotransmitters needed and balancing levels. </p>
<p>The difference in amounts of brain neurotransmitters found in men and women indicate that men need more dopamine than women and women need more serotonin than men. </p> 
<p>Dopamine rises during the day and is low during the evening and in sleep. In women dopamine rises along with estradiol (estrogen) which rises in the follicular phase and peaks around ovulation. </p>

<h2 id="dopamine-supplementation">Dopamine Supplementation<br /></h2>
<p>Nutritional co factors or agonists for dopamine are available in most supplemental forms. These include phenylalanine, tyrosine, iron, vitamin C, and vitamin B-complex as well as single individual B vitamins. </p>
<p>SAMe is also available as a supplement or methionine (cofactor amino acid for SAMe). </p>
<p>A healthy diet and where necessary supplements can maintain a healthy dopamine pathway. </p>
<p>Dopamine fasting which is a popular method in Silicon Valley to restore levels of dopamine by abstaining from activities that stimulate the dopaminergic pathway. Usually these activities are things that bring pleasure and may even become addictive. They include the excessive use of smartphones or other technological devices, social media, binge watching tv shows or movies, playing video games, excess food and sex. It is believed that through abstinence of pleasure activities dopamine levels may be restored. </p>
<p>Supplementing with a good quality omega 3 supplement will help assist with dopamine synthesis. </p>
<p>Magnesium and zinc levels should also be optimal as any imbalance will interfere with many bodily processes. </p>
<p>Reuptake inhibitors such as caffeine, nicotine and certain drugs are not the best way to increase neurotransmitters. Although caffeine and nicotine increase neurotransmitters such as dopamine they do this by maintaining the circulation of neurotransmitter which tricks the body into thinking more is available when in fact reserves are being used up. Optimal nutritional intake through diet and if required supplementation is the ideal way for neurotransmitter synthesis. </p> 
<p>Supplements or nutrients that help raise dopamine levels are best taking in the morning to help levels rise throughout the daylight hours. Avoid taking supplements such as phenylalanine or tyrosine in the evening as it is too stimulating and may interfere with sleep.</p>


<h2 id="deficiency-symptoms-of-dopamine">Deficiency Symptoms of Dopamine</h2>
<p>It is unknown how common dopamine deficiency and dopamine imbalance is amongst the population, however statistics on health conditions linked to the deficiency and imbalance can help estimate how likely it is to have this deficiency. </p>
<p>Unlike symptoms of mineral and vitamin deficiencies, changes in neurotransmitters whether low or unbalanced manifest as behaviorial changes along with certain physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of dopamine deficiency include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Decline in cognitive functions</li>
<li>Memory loss</li>
<li>Difficulty paying attention</li>
<li>Difficulty in problem-solving  </li> 
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Unable to focus </li>
<li>Easily distracted</li>
<li>Slow movement or speech</li>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Losing temper easily (due to minor setbacks) </li>
<li>Difficulty handling stress</li>
<li>Aggressiveness</li>
<li>Irritable</li>
<li>Unsociable (tendency towards isolation) </li>
<li>Apathy (lack interest or concern towards friends and family) </li>
<li>Muscle cramps, spasms, or tremors</li>
<li>Aches and pains </li>
<li>Stiffness in the muscles</li>

<li>Lack of interest </li>
<li>Loss of enthusiasm</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Anxiety [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11033344/]</li>
<li>Panic Attacks</li>
<li>Mood swings</li>
<li>Low self-esteem</li>
<li>Guilt-ridden</li>
<li>Suicidal thoughts </li>
<li>Self-harm (having thoughts of or actually injuring self) [<a href =" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2697009/" target="_blank">R</a>]</li>
<li>Feeling sad or tearful (without known reason) </li>
<li>Lack of pleasure or unable to feel pleasure (Anhedonia) </li>
<li>Lack of ability to feel love or love another</li>
<li>Lack of insight (Anosognosia) </li>
<li>Lack of self-awareness</li>
<li>Low sex drive (Low libido) </li>

<li>Weight changes (Weight loss or weight gain) </li>
<li>Addiction to stimulants</li>
<li>Psychosis</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
<li>Delusions</li>
</ul>

<p>Anger, aggressiveness, and irritability may increase when stressed. Low dopamine can make people feel hopeless which may be associated with feeling demotivated. </p>

<p>Deficiency of dopamine is linked to the following health conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Schizophrenia (Negative symptoms) </li>
<li>Psychosis</li>
<li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
<li>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) </li>
<li>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) </li>
<li>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) </li>
<li>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) </li>
<li>Fibromyalgia</li>
<li>Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) </li>
<li>Frequent pneumonia</li>
<li>Eating disorders (bulimia)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sociability is affected by low dopamine with a tendency towards isolation and a lack of interest or concern for friends or family members. </p>
<p>Low dopamine can also reduce self-awareness capabilities where the individual is unable to identify how they feel and how it manifests into daily actions with a tendency towards a loop of negative thinking and emotions. </p>
<p>Parkinson’s disease is mostly linked to low levels of dopamine and most of the symptoms are due to low dopamine. </p>
<p>Involuntary movements or repetitive tics have been shown to be helped by increasing dopamine levels. </p>
<p>Dopamine helps increase motivation and is thought of as the “achievement” molecule. A deficiency can cause a lack of motivation and lead to procrastination. It also greatly impairs cognition, reducing concentration and focus levels. People with low dopamine do not feel pleasure or find previous activities that helped induce feelings of pleasure to no longer have the same effect. </p>
<p>Dopamine is quickly degraded and excreted in the urine.  While there is some re-uptake, dopamine must be replenished. </p>

<p>Feeling less motivated and excited about things is a common underlying sign of a dopamine deficiency or insufficiency. </p>
<p>People with low dopamine will often feel fatigued and demotivated and displaying a lack of interest. In particular they can stop enjoying things they used to find enjoyable such as watching a movie, reading a book or showing lack of interest in hobbies that may have been enjoyable. </p>
<p>Although dopamine and serotonin are both involved in mood, deficiency of each leads different types of depressive low mood symptoms. A deficiency of dopamine tends to cause lower levels of motivation whereas a deficiency of serotonin can cause an imbalance in a person’s overall mood. </p>
<p>Dopamine and serotonin are involved in sleep, inflammation, appetite and energy levels. An imbalance or deficiency of these neurotransmitters can cause issues in these aspects of health. </p>
<p>Dopamine in the blood cannot cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the brain and dopamine levels in the brain are dependent on synthesis within the brain. </p>
<p>Dopamine may not be a direct cause of symptoms linked to depression as many other factors are in play, however depressive symptoms associated with low dopamine are distinguishable and include an increase in procrastination or feelings of demotivation, feeling apathy and a lack of pleasure. </p>
<p>One study has shown that catecholamine neurotransmitters in rat adrenals took four days to return to their normal levels after levels were depleted and required acetylcholine to help boost or initiate dopamine release [<a href ="https://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/7/4/389" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>A busy lifestyle or the stress of academic studies, work and other factors which add stress can delay restoring neurotransmitter levels as stress can cause the adrenals to burnout leading to a condition known as adrenal fatigue. The adrenal glands are important for the synthesis of catecholamines and hormones the body relies on. </p> 

<p>People with Parkinson’s disease are found to be low on dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine and low tyrosine hydroxylase. Parkinson’s is mostly treated with L-dopa which is found to deplete tyrosine, tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), serotonin and sulfur amino acids cysteine and methionine. Studies have shown that taking L-dopa with 5-HTP, L-tyrosine, L-cysteine and cofactors have shown to be effective. [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068871/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Causes of depression vary with a deficiency of dopamine and result in specific symptoms linked to depression. </p>
<p>Depression can be a balancing act between the two neurotransmitters serotonin which needs tryptophan and norepinephrine which needs tyrosine or phenylalanine. There needs to be a healthy balanced ratio of both neurotransmitters. In some cases taking high doses of tryptophan to increase serotonin can cause psychiatric and depressive symptoms to become worse when other neurotransmitters such as dopamine or norepinephrine may be deficient. If serotonin levels are low then tryptophan use may be very helpful and reduce associated symptoms of deficiency but if norepinephrine or dopamine is low these symptoms can be made worse, in this case tyrosine or phenylalanine should help address symptoms associated with depression. </p>
<h4>Tyrosine type of depression:</h4> 
<p>Low mood associated with low levels of tyrosine are quite different to low mood linked to a low level of tryptophan or serotonin in that the person is often craving foods particularly high in tyrosine which includes cheese, chocolate and other foods containing tyrosine. There is also a craving of high sugar or high simple carbohydrates food but with the addition of foods containing tyrosine. </p> 
<p>Like tryptophan there is also a link to gut health, in this case if digestive issues exist such as low hydrochloric acid to help digest food properly this will greatly reduce absorption and utilization of the nutrients necessary for balanced mood. Other digestive issues such as candidiasis can also hinder proper digestion and therefore utilization of tyrosine. In these cases tyrosine is converted to tyramine. Unlike tryptophan, tyrosine does not need carbohydrates to cross the blood brain barrier although some carbohydrates may help. However gut health is imperative where an unhealthy gut microbiome can cause tyrosine to convert to tyramine. </p>
<p>Like tryptophan, tyrosine also needs some carbohydrates to cross the blood brain barrier but is better to take on an empty stomach to avoid other amino acids from competing. </p>
<p>BCAAs can compete with phenylalanine or tyrosine and high amounts should be avoided when trying to address a deficiency. Tryptophan competes with phenylalanine or tyrosine for transport across the blood brain barrier. </p>
<p>Depression and anhedonia is linked to a reduced striatal dopamine response to reward. </p>
<p>Although some medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs increase levels of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine they have many side effects which may be prolonged with long term use. In this case it is important to address the underlying cause which is more than often inadequate nutritional intake. </p>
<p>Many antipsychotic medications are dopamine antagonists. </p>
<p>Some effective anti-nausea (anti-sickness) medications are also dopamine antagonists. </p>
<p>Causes of deficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>High caffeine intake</li>
<li>Caffeine can lower blood levels of tyrosine and also inhibits iron absorption. The reduced tyrosine may be from the effects of caffeine using up tyrosine. </li>
<li>Caffeine can also raise cortisol levels and the effects of stress [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668773/" target="_blank">R</a>] </li>
<li>Caffeine inhibits absorption and blocks action of adenosine [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/" target="_blank">R</a>]</li>
<li>Impaired gut health (candida, parasites, low stomach acid etc) </li>
<li>Lack of dietary intake of cofactors (phenylalanine, tyrosine and other nutrients) </li>
<li>Converting into too much tyramine</li>
<li>Chronic stress </li>
<li>Aging </li>
<li>Folate deficiency</li>
<li>BH4 deficiency</li>
<li>Insufficient or impaired dopamine synthesis</li>
</ul>
<p>Tyramine causes the adrenal glands to work harder and uses up reserves of noradrenaline simultaneously depriving glands such as the thyroid glands of tyrosine. This can lead to a deficiency of the catecholamine neurotransmitters. Some of the deficiency symptoms that can occur if tyrosine cannot be converted to epinephrine include fatigue, pain, depression and apathy. </p>
<p>The adrenal glands are important for the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters. Malfunctioning or impaired adrenal glands from chronic stress can lead to adrenal fatigue. </p>
<p>Chronic stress over stimulates the sympathetic nervous system which can deplete dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Chronic stress uses up reserves of important neurotransmitters for stress such as norepinephrine. Symptoms of chronic stress include anxiety, insomnia, inflammation, weight gain, high blood pressure and a weakened immune system [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4684895/" target="_blank">R</a>]
[<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22986366/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Replenishing nutritional cofactors for hormones and neurotransmitters along with using practical methods to manage stress is important for overall health and wellbeing. </p>
<p>Estrogen levels are seen to rise along with dopamine and serotonin with low levels associated with both low dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine deficiency along with low serotonin levels can reduce ability to focus and cause issues with cognitive function. Both neurotransmitters also have an impact on mood and pain. </p>
<p>Aging causes a decline of dopamine levels by up to 10% for every decade from early adulthood. This decline can be seen with the significant decline in cognitive and motor functions. Aging also increases neurological symptoms which can manifest as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. </p>
<p>Low levels of estrogen is also linked to low levels of dopamine and numerous studies have been done in post-menopausal women [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15288710/] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596698/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) are usually available as prescription medication and also as natural herbs which increase the available amounts of the catecholamines. </p>
<p>Lack of dopamine is associated with some degenerative conditions. Insufficient dopamine has been linked to Parkinson’s disease [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6150071/]</p>
<p>Dopamine helps regulate production of prolactin which is the main hormone found in pregnant women and new mothers. Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain which increases breast growth and lactation (milk production) during pregnancy and after birth. </p>
<p>If dopamine levels are low the prolactin production is also low. Prolactin has some important functions which includes regulation of the immune system, metabolism, reproductive systems and behaviour. Prolactin has shown to decrease estrogen and testosterone levels, two hormones that work alongside with dopamine. Stress increases prolactin to very high levels. </p> 
<p>D1 receptors agonists include Parkinson’s medications. Terguride is a serotonin receptor antagonist (5-HT2B, 5HT2A) and dopamine agonist used as treatment for hyperprolactinemia (hypoestrogenism), PCOS and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. </p>
<p>Schizophrenia is likely due to an imbalance in dopaminergic pathways that signal D2 and D1 receptors. </p>
<p>Most antipsychotic medications are antagonists for the dopamine D2 receptor which reduces dopamine activity. </p>
<p>Dopaminergic neuronal degeneration is characteristic of Parkinson’s disease with the D2 receptor being the main subtype affected. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22612810/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Obesity is linked to low levels of dopamine through the stimulation of dopaminergic transmission and especially of the D2 receptor through rewarding food. The reduced activation of this receptor may induce pathological eating and lead to obesity. </p> 
<p>Post-mortem of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) has shown low dopamine in the central and basal nuclei of the amygdala when compared with control subjects. This disorder is characterized by persistent and intense feelings of sadness for long periods of time. [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5716179/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>

<p>Dopamine plays a part in the decision making process when deciding whether a goal is worth the effort.  [<a href ="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/dopamine-affects-how-brain-decides-whether-goal-worth-effort " target="_blank">R</a>]. This may mean that low dopamine can impair decision making process and prevent making balanced decisions. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16060800/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>


<h2 id="toxicity-symptoms-of-dopamine">Toxicity Symptoms of Dopamine</h2>

<p>Dopamine toxicity is not very common however levels can get too high with excessive supplementation of cofactors. 
<p>High levels of any single neurotransmitter can lower levels of other neurotransmitters causing an imbalance and deficiency symptoms of other neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of excess dopamine include: </p>
<li>Pleasure seeking (such as sex, food, drugs or other forms of thrill seeking) </li>
<li>High libido (hypersexuality can lead to promiscuity as another form of pleasure seeking) </li>
<li>Addiction (addictive behaviour) </li>
<li>Hyper-focus (Feeling “locked in” with others moving in slow motion) </li>
<li>Increased energy</li>
<li>Hyperactivity</li>
<li>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) </li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Sleeping difficulties (Insomnia) </li>
<li>Excess saliva</li>
<li>Digestive issues</li>
<li>Constipation</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Schizophrenia</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
<li>Delusions</li>
<li>Paranoia</li>
<li>Mania or feelings of insanity</li>
<li>Racing thoughts</li>
<li>Psychosis</li>
</ul>
<p>Excess levels of dopamine are similar to low levels in that they can cause depression and constipation however with major differences in most symptoms. </p>
<p>Conditions linked to high levels of dopamine include the following: </p>
<li>Costello syndrome</li>
<li>Leukemia</li>
<li>Menkes syndrome</li>
<li>Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency</li>
<li>Vitamin B6 deficiency </li>
</ul>

<p>Dopamine increases the requirement of vitamin B6 [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2035239/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>

<p>Dopamine inhibits the effects of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine helps regulate melatonin production. Too much dopamine will prevent norepinephrine synthesis which will decrease synthesis and release of melatonin</p>

<p>Causes of high dopamine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addictions</li>
<li>Low MAO</li>
<li>Certain medications</li>
</ul>
<p>When dopamine levels increase the hormones cortisol, DHEA and estrogen decrease. DHEA is found to be low in those with schizophrenia. </p>
<p>During dopamine sensitivity additional intake of dopamine raising supplements such as tyrosine, l-dopa, omega 3 and curcumin can significantly increase dopamine causing manic symptoms. There are other many possible causes of dopamine surge such as overstimulating activities becoming addictive. </p>
<p>Many activities can overstimulate the reward system such as shopping, gambling, watching TV shows (binge watching), social media, using mobile devices, taking drugs and other activities that feel good so that the behaviour is then repeated. Whilst doing these activities raises dopamine levels if addictions are formed it can quickly use up cofactors needed for dopamine synthesis. Some people may have too much dopamine which is not converting to norepinephrine which can cause an imbalance. A high conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine also poses issues.  </p>
<p>When shopping after making a purchase this can help release endorphins and dopamine which can quickly become addictive and compulsive shopping may be repeated in order to induce the same reward and feeling a rush of instant gratification. Usually the behaviour will be repeated regardless of financial consequences as seen similarly with gambling. Norepinephrine which is the second neurotransmitter synthesised in the catecholamines pathway has a link with feeling aversion to financial loss and may be implicated in addictive behaviour. </p>
<p>It is believed that emotional responses to gains and “loss aversion” varies widely between people. Some studies have found that people with lower levels of the norepinephrine transporter in their brain but higher norepinephrine have a different response to those who have higher norepinephrine transporter and lower norepinephrine. The studies reveal that gamblers have less aversion to monetary loss which can cause more problems with gambling addiction.  In the study participants with less norepinephrine displayed loss aversion with their emotional responses to losses heightened. </p>
[<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4158979/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22349782/" target="_blank">R</a>] 
[<a href ="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00586.x " target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>Norepinephrine levels have been found to be high in pathological gamblers. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840429/]</p>
<p>Shopping on sales, using discounts or vouchers can cause an even more addictive shopping habits. </p> 
<p>The feelings of pleasure, excitement and happiness reinforces the behaviour which causes the activity to become an addiction. </p>
<p>Binge watching, gambling, reading books (getting hooked on a story line), drugs (illicit and some medication), shopping, sugar addiction, food (binge eating), porn addiction, sex, social media activity, playing video games and phone activity can all cause surges of dopamine release. </p>
<p>Addictive cycles with dopamine stimulants (whether it is a substance or through gambling) can lead to fatigue and depression. </p>
<p>Consequently the activities that cause a dopamine surge can use up dopamine synthesizing cofactors. The activities become addictions through the good feelings aroused by dopamine surges and reinforcing the behaviour which makes the participant seek out another hit for another high. </p>
<p>These feelings of arousal, motivation and feeling happy can be positive if the behaviour or activity needed is not detrimental like gambling or excessive shopping that can cause financial strain. </p>
<p>Catecholamines which include the neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine are important in stress responses (fight-or-flight). These neurotransmitters get your body ready for fight-or-flight emergencies. If there are high levels of dopamine then potentially this level of dopamine may convert to more norepinephrine which can cause symptoms of excess. Although these catecholamines have important functions in the body high levels can lead to high blood pressure, headaches, sweating, pounding of the heart, pain in the chest, and anxiety. </p>
<p>High levels of dopamine concentrated in certain parts of the brain and not in others causes an imbalance with poor impulse control, competitiveness and aggressive behaviour. </p>
<p>An imbalance of dopamine can cause a host of behavioural and psychological conditions. These conditions include ADHD, binge eating, addiction and gambling. </p>
<p>Monoamine oxidase A (MAO) is involved in the breakdown of the neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin after their function has ended. Stress initiates higher production of catecholamines which require more MAO for degradation so the body can return to a calm state. </p>
<p>When humans or animals are frightened the catecholamines specifically norepinephrine and epinephrine are squirted into circulation to increase heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure to get ready for fighting or running away. If the MAOs are deficient or absent then these neurohormones or neurotransmitters do not break down and remain in circulation for a long time which causes a prolonged state of panic and anxiety. </p>
<p>Low or insufficient levels of MAO will cause a continuous circulation of catecholamines. </p>
<p>Low serotonin with high dopamine levels has been linked to kleptomania and has been treated with behavioral or psychotherapy and pharmacological therapies. Common drugs used in treatment of kleptomania include Selective serotonin inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic anti depressants (TCAs) and opioid antagonists. [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12768528/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC535651/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
[<a href =" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327510329_Kleptomania-the_Compulsion_to_Steal" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>Dopamine detox is a practice followed in order to prevent excessive dopamine flooding which are often due to engaging in activities that induces release of this neurotransmitter. The practice involved reducing or eliminating activities that stimulate dopamine release. The activities include phone browsing, social media, binge eating, binge watching TV or any other addictive activities. The idea is to help the brain detox and restore a natural calm state of mind. </p>
<p>Dopamine detox acts by increasing dopamine receptor sensitivity and requires self-control to avoid urges to sensitize dopamine receptors which can help balance dopamine levels in the brain. </p>
<p>When dopamine receptor sensitivity is reduced this can lead to addictions. </p>
<p>Some extreme addictions may require rehabilitation. </p>
<p>Genetic differences that alter the expression of dopamine receptors in the brain can help determine if a person will find stimulants appealing or aversive. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629211/]
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032992/]</p>
<p>Ingestion of stimulants such as some street drugs can increase dopamine levels in the brain which activate the D2 receptors and associated with psychosis. Amphetamines and cocaine can cause paranoia. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630156/] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181074/]</p>
<p>Excessive increase of dopamine can change the structure of the brain creating behavioural abnormalities related to addictions. </p>
<p>Addictive behaviour is greatly implicated by the dopaminergic system. Binge watching TV shows creates a continuous production of dopamine. Dopamine leads to a high often correlated with the use of illicit drugs. Any activity that releases dopamine can then become an addiction, because the subject is constantly seeking a hit for their next high that the activity then becomes a repetitive pattern. </p>
<p>Studies have shown that the brain area involved in gambling addiction is similar to the area used in drug addiction. Both activities causes the same changes in the brain which can last for a long time and may be permanent. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3803105/]</p>
<p>Dopamine is involved in the feedback signal for predicting rewards which can be closely observed when playing games. Neurotransmission of dopamine does not only release during pleasurable activities but may also transmit signals when a gambler is close enough to winning.</p>
<p>Studies on roulette players have shown a release of dopamine when players have a near miss or almost win the same as when they win. This release of dopamine does not signal the feeling of pleasure but instead how close the player has got to the reward which encourages another attempt. In some scenarios this getting close to a reward may be useful such as in the work environment but lead the way for addictive behaviour such as in gambling. This release of dopamine can also be experienced when playing the lottery where each number is off by one number.
[<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3845016/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Addiction to drugs also work with this similar feedback signal for predicting rewards, where instead of actually deriving pleasure as is attested by many drug addicts who do not find taking the drug to induce feeling high yet feel the need or urge to try again as if they might be close to achieving the reward. </p>
<p>Dopamine fires at different modes known as phasic or tonic. </p>
<p>Phasic (Surging) dopamine neurons release, fire extra spikes or in bursts and occur occasionally and in brief episodes. </p>
<p>Tonic dopamine neurons release, fire spontaneously as sustained response and at low rates and is active for the duration of the stimulus. </p> 
<p>Phasic dopamine release is more associated with reward motivation than tonic dopamine release. [<a href ="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6634758/" target="_blank">R</a>]  [<a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6150071/]" target="_blank">R</a></p>
<p>Although dopamine increases enthusiasm and motivation in a positive way it can also cause motivation to avoid experiences that cause aversion such as seen in war veterans when reminded of battle and associated combat stress.
