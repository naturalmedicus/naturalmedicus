<h2 id="description"><strong>What is Acetylcholine?</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Acetylcholine (Ach) is an excitatory neurotransmitter and also acts as a neuromodulator. It is found distributed throughout the nervous system where it is synthesised. Acetylcholine interacts with other neurotransmitters as well as gonadal hormones and thyroid hormones. Acetylcholine is released in very small amounts from the brain and peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p>It controls many of the body’s nerves including excitatory but also functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine is categorized in the monoamine group of neurotransmitters with the others being dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline).</p>
<p>Acetylcholine excitatory functions are involved in skeletal muscle contraction and has inhibitory effects on the heart and brain. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine is one of the first neurotransmitters to be discovered. It is the main learning neurotransmitter involved in thought and memory. Its other functions are involved with muscle action, attention, motivation, awakening and sleep. Acetylcholine plays a role in in arousal, emotion, and cognition.</p>
<p>Dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are monoamine neurotransmitters, also categorised as catecholamines. These neurotransmitters are released in very small amounts from the brain and peripheral nervous system. They also play an important role in arousal, emotion, and cognition.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine has two types of receptors known as muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.</p>
<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand- gated ion channels. nAChRs are part of the “Cys-loop” superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that includes GABAA, glycine, and serotonin (5-HT3) receptors. nAChRs ligand- gated ion channels are permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. Ligand-gated ion channels open when a chemical ligand such as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine binds to the protein. In the open state they allow the ions to travel through the channel across the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>There are two types of nicotinic receptors known as muscle-type and neuronal-type. The muscle-type receptors are mostly found on muscle cells and neuronal-type are found in the central nervous system and in the two types of autonomic ganglia (sympathetic and parasympathetic).</p>
<p>Nicotine acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist which is why it is able to effect brain activity. It is chemically similar to acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine may not be as popular as other neurotransmitters but has many essential functions within the brain and in the body.</p>
<p>Cholinergic and GABAergic pathways are connected in the hippocampus and basal forebrain [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5036520/" >https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5036520/</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7050826/" >https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7050826/</a>][<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11242563/" >https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11242563/</a>]</p>

<h2 id="health-benefits"><strong>Health Benefits of Acetylcholine</strong></h2>
<h3>Stimulates Skeletal Muscular Functions</h3>
<p>Acetylcholine is important for the skeletal muscular functions and muscle control and needed for the body’s muscle action. It is involved in stimulating skeletal muscles, smooth muscles and tells muscles to twitch and contract as well as other functions. It also has important functions in the autonomic nervous system and sensory neurons.</p>

<h3>Needed for bodily functions</h3>
<p>Many bodily functions and processes depend on acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has some involvement in blood pressure as it dilates blood vessels. It can slow down heart rate and increase body secretion. It can however also increase blood pressure. The different functions acetylcholine has depends on location of the receptors and the type of receptors in the body.</p>
<p>Similar to dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine the release of acetylcholine is involved in the high-arousal states.</p>



<h3>Needed for Cognitive Functions</h3>
<p>Acetylcholine plays an essential role in some of the major cognitive functions such as attention, alertness, learning and memory. It signals to the hippocampus to store a memory</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is a very important factor in the memory functions with deficiency of this neurotransmitter being linked with Alzheimer’s disease. Due to its role in memory it is also essential for thought processes and learning.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is also involved in motivation.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is also involved in fear-based memories. When a person learns something new which causes fear there is more acetylcholine in the system which will help consolidate the memory to remind the person to be afraid of the same incident, event or situation in the future. Whilst this sounds counterproductive it is a useful function, however excess acetylcholine is linked to anxiety often fear based which can be caused also by deficits of other neurotransmitters or hormones.</p>
<p>Dopamine which is another monoamine neurotransmitter is similar to acetylcholine and also needed for memory, learning, attention, cognition, motivation and arousal. Any impairment in these functions can also be a sign of low dopamine instead of acetylcholine which can likely be determined through directly raising levels of either dopamine or acetylcholine.  </p>
<p>Acetylcholine is needed for learning and for creating new memories. Acetylcholine is a helpful neurotransmitter especially when focusing on studies or mental activities that require focus as it is helpful with learning and memory. </p>
<p>Studies are showing that choline may be an effective treatment for certain neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke and tardive dyskinesia. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4787279/] </p>
<p>In one study lecithin has shown to suppress tardive dyskinesia. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/642995/] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579609/] [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/375755/] [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28396257/]</p>
<p>Prenatal choline supplementation has shown to offer neuroprotection in studies on male and female rats and perinatal supplementation of choline has shown to protect against fetal alcohol exposure and seizures. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3327365/]</p>

<h3>Involved in Sleep</h3>
<p>Acetylcholine is needed for both sleep and wakefulness. It is directly involved in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep with studies showing higher levels of acetylcholine are present during REM sleep and awakening.</p>
<p>It is needed to promote REM sleep and when balanced with other neurotransmitters that are involved in sleep such as norepinephrine and serotonin it can help with restful sleep which is needed for overall health and wellbeing. </p>
<p>Furthermore sleep is essential for the health of the brain with restful sleep being a factor in improved cognitive functions and brain plasticity.</p>
<p>Although low levels of acetylcholine is needed in sleep it is strongest during REM sleep as well as when awake. REM sleep is involved in memory consolidation a process needed to consolidate what has been learned from the information and memories gathered throughout the day which can improve brain plasticity.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine helps the brain by retaining information during the day and setting the same information during sleep.
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7294415/] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748083/]
</p>
<p>During womens monthly cycle in the different phase there are changes in the type of sleep involved.  The monthly cycle includes menstruation and ovulation and is divided in two parts known as the follicular phase and luteal phase. More REM sleep is present during follicular phase whereas in the latter part, luteal phase REM sleep is reduced. In comparison there is more REM sleep in follicular phase than luteal phase. The luteal phase has more NREM sleep which may have a connection with another neurotransmitter GABA and progesterone.</p>
<p>Diets rich in choline promote REM sleep and memory and may be the reason for more vivid dreaming.  </p>


<h3>Supports release of other Neurotransmitters and Hormones</h3>
<p>Acetylcholine in small amounts stimulates the release of other important neurotransmitters which includes dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the release of various hormones which are important for many vital functions within the body. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters play a major role in behaviour. In the central nervous system acetylcholine is involved in anger and aggression likely due to its balancing role of other neurotransmitters. When serotonin is high this often reduces fear levels which can cause impulsive aggression. Acetylcholine reduces serotonin and may mediate this effect. High acetylcholine levels also decrease norepinephrine levels the main neurotransmitter involved in anger.  </p>


<h3>Supports sexual health</h3>
<p>Acetylcholine is involved in the release of thyroid hormones (through its role in activating dopamine release) which are needed for sexual functions and play a role in desire and arousal. </p>
<p>Decrease of acetylcholine can impact sexual health. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine is important for regulating internal moisture with a deficiency causing sexual health problems. In women this has negative impact causing vaginal dryness and can diminish sexual desire. In men lower internal moisture can greatly impact amount of semen in men. Acetylcholine can help with vaginal lubrication in women and improve amount of semen in men.</p>


<h3>Supports the immune system</h3>
<p>Acetylcholine plays an important role in infections and the immune response. Acetylcholine synthesised by immune cells is essential for T cells to migrate to site of infection (infected tissues). </p>
<h3>May lower risk of some forms of cancer</h3>
<p>Choline, which is an important nutrient needed for acetylcholine synthesis, may lower risk of breast cancer. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19635752/]</p>
<p>Choline along with other nutrients such as B9 (folate), B12 (pyridoxal phosphate), and methionine play important part in the methyl donor system and cancer protection [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954304/]
[https://jcmtjournal.com/article/view/2050] </p>
<p>Studies are showing that dietary methyl donor restriction along with Fatty acid metabolism may help protect against colon cancer [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8416812/] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3397832/]</p>
<h3>May help mood</h3>
<p>Acetylcholine can regulate mood and reduce anxiety. </p>

<p>Some medications such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists can improve mood, alleviate symptoms of depression as well as improving cognitive function by increasing the activity of the nicotinic receptors. </p>

<p>Nicotine has been shown in both animal and human studies to target nAChRs and can reduce aggression.
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486625/]
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32058178/]</p>
<p>Nicotine acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist which is why it is able to effect brain activity. It is chemically similar to acetylcholine. Nicotine is commonly used in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to help people who are chronic smokers to quit smoking. </p>

<p>Neurotransmitter acetylcholine produced in the Acetylcholine Pathway </p>
<p>The body is able to synthesize phosphatidylcholine, which is produced from choline, however it may not be able to produce amount required which means choline will need to be obtained from dietary intake. Phosphatidylcholine is available as a supplement. [https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/] </p>
<p>There are three different pathways through which phosphatidylcholine may be synthesised, the CDP-choline pathway (also known as the Kennedy pathway or de-novo pathway), the Lands’ cycle and phosphatidylethanolamine methyl transferase (PEMT) pathway (made in the liver). </p>
<p><strong>Lands’ Cycle</strong></p>
<img src="lands_cycle.png" alt="Lands' cycle">

<p><strong>PEMT Pathway</strong></p>
<p>The PEMT diagram demonstrates the biosynthesis pathway for the production of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from phosphatidylethanolamine via PEMT (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) which takes place in the liver. The cell membranes mostly contain PC and the body needs to make this regularly to keep up with various processes in the body such as cellular repair and growth.  Phosphatidylcholine supplementation can help offload extra strain on methylation by allowing more methyl groups to be utilized for other processes that depend on methylation.</p>

<p><strong>CDP-choline pathway (Kennedy pathway</strong></p>
<img src="http://www.naturalmedicus.com/images/nutrition-images/nt-images/cdp-choline-pathway.png" alt="CDP Choline Pathway">

<p>Choline kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes choline in the first step of the CDP-choline pathway to form phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). </p> 
<p>Choline kinase needs magnesium ions (+2), choline which is the main precursor as well as ATP which produces adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphocholine. Phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) transfers to choline to produce phosphocholine (PC). </p>
<p>In the second step the enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) and catalyzes phosphocholine into CDP-choline. This step is a rate-limiting and regulated step in the CDP-choline pathway. </p>
<p>CDP-choline is produced in the body and a precursor for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. It is available as Citicoline CDP-choline supplements. </p>
<p>In the final step the enzyme choline phosphotransferase is needed for biosynthesis of PtdCho and lipids derived from PtdCho.

<p>Choline acetyltransferase enzyme (ChAT) found in nerve terminal cytoplasm helps with acetylcholine synthesis and needs cofactors acetyl coenzyme A and choline</p>
<p>Pyruvate is an important molecule at the intersection of multiple metabolic pathways</p>
<p>Pyruvate is needed to convert into acetyl-CoA, vitamin B5 and B1 helps this process and can convert to fatty acids or energy. Through gluconeogenesis pyruvate can be converted in carbohydrates. Pyruvate can also convert to amino acid alanine and ethanol. </p>
<p>Vitamin B1 is needed to keep the nervous system and muscles around the body healthy. It is involved in the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the nervous system which help with contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle and is dependent on a sufficient supply of vitamin B1. An imbalance of acetylcholine can lead to the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis that causes muscle weakness and fatigue. </p> 
<p>Thiamine is needed for the synthesis of acetylcholine</p>
<p>Thiamine pyrophosphate coenzyme is needed for the decarboxylation of α-oxoacids and specifically for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl Coenzyme A</p>
<p>Catabolism of isoleucine, leucine, and threonine forms Acetyl-CoA </p>
<p>Lysine and tryptophan each form two acetyl-CoA molecules</p>
<p>Metabolism of cysteine, alanine, and tryptophan help form pyruvate</p>
<p>Acetyl-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A) is a molecule that is involved in multiple biochemical reactions in protein, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Primary function of Acetyl-CoA is to transport the acetyl group to the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) to be oxidized for energy production. </p>
<p>Other cofactors needed to generate acetyl CoA include Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), Lipoic acid, Magnesium ions (Mg2+)</p>
<p>There are ten amino acids that can be degraded to Acetyl-CoA, five of which enter through pyruvate include alanine, glycine, serine, cysteine, and tryptophan</p>
<p>The amino acids lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine also convert to acetyl-CoA. Some may also convert to acetoacetyl-CoA which is then converted into acetyl-CoA</p>
<p>Lecithin consumption increases acetylcholine concentrations in rat brain and adrenal gland [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/694529/]</p>
<p>Choline is the one of the most important and main cofactor for acetylcholine production</p>
<p>Choline (Vitamin B4) and Inositol (Vitamin B8) function in a very similar way. When paired together it can help to synthesize acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters enhancing and improving cognitive function. </p>
<p>Like many of the B vitamins choline is water soluble which means the body needs to constantly synthesize or replenish this nutrient and plays an important role in the synthesis of acetylcholine (neurotransmitter), cell-membrane signaling (phospholipids), lipid transport (lipoproteins) and lowering homocysteine levels. </p>
<p>Higher folate intake requires less choline. </p>
<p>One research has found that folate intake determines the requirement of choline. Those who have adequate folate levels from leafy green vegetables and some grains have a lower requirement for choline than those who are getting less folate. </p>
<p>A deficiency of choline has been linked to gallstones with some studies showing signs of gallstones dissolving when on a diet rich in phosphatidylcholine, another form of choline and found in lecithin. This may mean if a diet becomes deficient in choline it may contribute to gallstones. Since choline is needed for acetylcholine synthesis, if acetylcholine production uses up choline reserves this may contribute to gallstone if it is not quickly replenished. Supplementation with herbal extracts and any nutrients besides choline that can increase acetylcholine such as Huperzine A may use up choline rapidly and should be used with caution. </p> 
<p>In the body phosphatidycholine (lecithin) is converted to glycerophosphatidylcholine and then to choline.  Acetylcholine can then be generated by adding acetyl coenzyme A to choline. This is illustrated in the diagram for the acetylcholine pathway for the phosphatidylcholine conversion to choline. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11746-007-1081-1] </p>
<p>Choline is needed for cell communication and used to make phosphatidylcholine</p> 
<p>Acetylcholine is needed for activating dopamine pathway. When acetylcholine receptors are activated dopamine increases</p>
<p>Serotonin may also need small amounts of acetylcholine to be activated</p>
<p>Inositol works with choline which when combined form lecithin, an essential component for cell membranes which protect cells from oxidation and protect the myelin sheath. This is important for regulating nerve transmissions </p>
<p>Many studies are showing potential benefits of inositol on mental health conditions such as anxiety, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder ADHD. Reports of inositol use reveal an increased levels of energy and improved memory, mental alertness and concentration. It has also shown to be helpful with treating anxiety. </p>
<p>Inositol can help regulate mood through its involvement in the manufacturing of serotonin, melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and GABA. These neurotransmitters require inositol for transmitting messages between the brain cells. A deficiency of inositol has been linked to various mental health problems which includes depression, anxiety and panic attacks where many of the neurotransmitters are out of balance. </p>
<p>Iodine along with selenium plays a very important role in the thyroid by supporting and maintaining its functions in the body. Iodine is needed for T4 and T3 production. In the brain these hormones are needed to activate neurotransmitters acetylcholine and others such as dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and GABA. Deficiency in iodine is linked to poor cognitive functions and intellectual disability. </p>
<p>A deficiency in thyroid hormones T4 and T3 can lead to problems with cognition, memory, focus, concentration and mood. </p>
<p>Folic acid or folate which is the active form of vitamin B9 helps the body produce new cells is needed for the synthesis of acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine needs many of the B vitamins. B vitamins are needed for the production of many of the neurotransmitters and important for neurological health. Some of these B vitamins include vitamin B1 (Thiamin), B2 (Riboflavin), B3 (Niacin), B6 (Pyridoxine) and B12 (cobalamin). </p>
<p>Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is needed to form coenzyme A</p>
<p>Coenzyme A is needed for melatonin and acetylcholine synthesis</p>
<p>Acetylcholine has a role in calcium release. Calcium influx through specific presynaptic Ca2+ channels triggers release of acetylcholine [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1382687/]

<p>Essential fatty acids are needed to help with acetylcholine transmission [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775891/]</p>
<p>Cholinergic transmission depends on long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [LC-PUFAs]. In one study the deficiency of the enzyme needed to convert alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) depleted synaptic vesicles and reduced cholinergic tone at neuromuscular junctions which was then restored with the addition of DHA.

<p>When acetylcholine increases the neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and glutamate also increases</p>
<p>During glutamate resistance or reduced glutamate acetylcholine becomes the main excitatory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>AChE inhibitors or cholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine by inhibiting the action of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme needed to break down acetylcholine. AChE inhibitors include the drugs donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine (Exelon). </p>

<h2 id="food-sources"><strong>Food source</strong></h2>
<p>Acetylcholine cannot be obtained from food directly as it is synthesised in the body through cofactor nutrients that help the brain and body to produce acetylcholine where it is needed. A balanced healthy diet can maintain brain health and ensure adequate synergistic combinations of nutrients for the synthesis of neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>It is important to eat foods rich in choline and also tyrosine. </p>
<p>Choline food sources include beef, liver, oysters, caviar, chicken, turkey, pork, salmon, cod, eggs (egg yolk), milk, kidney beans, lima beans, navy beans, chickpeas, lentils, lecithin, soy, brewer’s yeast, red potatoes, brussels sprouts, broccoli cauliflower, rice, wheat germ, quinoa and peanuts. </p>
<p>*High amounts of choline can be found in soy products and soy lecithin. A single meal containing lecithin can increase choline and acetylcholine in rat adrenal gland and brain tissue. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/694529/]</p>
<p>Soy lecithin from and organic and Non-GMO source are best for consumption. When consuming soy products fermented soy is a better choice for healthy digestion and these include, tempeh, natto and miso. </p>
<p>Fruits, vegetables and grains contain minimal amounts of choline. </p>
<p>Also of importance is food containing most of the B vitamins especially vitamin B1, B5 and inositol. </p>
<p>Food sources of Vitamin B1 include beef(heart, liver, kidney), lamb, milk, nuts, oatmeal, oat bran, whole grains, oranges, pork (liver), eggs, seeds, legumes, peas, pumpkin and yeast (Brewer’s). Rice, pasta, breads, cereals and flour are often fortified with B1. </p>

<p>Although most foods contain small amounts of vitamin B1 large amounts can be found in organ meats such as beef and pork liver. </p>

<h2 id="recommended-daily-allowance"><strong>Recommended daily allowance</strong></h2>
<p>There are no set amounts of recommended daily allowance for neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter synthesis depend on the nutrients obtained from the diet or supplementation. Brainwave frequencies and other practices such as meditation can also effect levels of neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are made from protein and amino acids. They also need other cofactors such as vitamins and minerals for synthesis. </p>
<p>Dietary protein is therefore essential and getting adequate, sufficient supply of all nutrients in the correct balance is essential. </p>
<p>A healthy adult needs between 40 and 70 grams of daily protein intake. This can go up to as much as 90 grams for active and athletic people. </p>
<p>Choline is one of the main precursors for acetylcholine. Taking more than 3g of choline per day is considered unsafe and poses health risks. An adequate amount of choline for healthy individuals is between 425-550mg per day. </p>
<p>The recommended amount of choline is about 5 grams per day, however different health conditions may influence amount required. </p>
<p>Choline and cofactors for acetyl coenzyme A are necessary for acetylcholine synthesis and are needed in sufficient amounts. </p>
<p>Diet and nutritional supplementation can be tweaked to meet the requirement of necessary nutrients and ensuring adequate levels of neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters operate at different times of the day and are largely dictated by light exposure. Excitatory neurotransmitters operate more during the day with the exception of serotonin which relies on sunlight to enter the retinas of the eyes. Serotonin and dopamine are produced mostly during daylight hours. During dark hours the serotonin converts to melatonin and more GABA is present. </p>
<p>Brainwaves also correspond with the different neurotransmitters. In the morning the brain has alpha waves which increase to beta waves throughout the day. Gamma waves may also facilitate the daylight hours and ideal for higher learning. The alpha and beta waves facilitate acetylcholine and dopamine. </p>
<p>Other factors such as the seasons and a woman’s monthly menstrual cycle can also determine the amount of specific neurotransmitters needed and at which point of the cycle. For example in the luteal phase GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter as this part of the phase we see a spike in the hormone progesterone which works synergistically with this calming neurotransmitter. Serotonin will also be present at this time as well as more conversion into melatonin to facilitate sleep. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine activates dopamine for release which makes it likely that it will be needed in the follicular phase in line with the rise of estrogen and dopamine. Studies also show that sensitivity to nicotine which acts on nicotinic receptors is reduced during the luteal phase when progesterone is high. This means women have a significant response or experience effects of the nicotinic receptors more in the follicular phase when estrogen is higher. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4847745/] [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21186920/]</p>
<p>Dopamine will also be more available during the follicular phase which seems to increase with the rise of the female reproductive hormone estrogen. </p>
<p>In northern climates during winter with the lack of sunlight, there is likely to be a lower production of serotonin or higher amounts of this may convert to melatonin possibly through daylight hours shortening. This may pick up slightly as spring emerges. Many people also find that spring makes them feel motivated. Dopamine also lowers during winter which may mean less acetylcholine may be required. </p>
<p>Studies show that estradiol levels are lower during the winter months which may be a reason why some women are more susceptible to SAD than men. People with SAD have higher melatonin levels and lower dopamine and norepinephrine. [https://www.thepositivepsychologypeople.com/winter-blues-vs-winter-excitement] </p>
<p>During winter when dopamine levels are lower, norepinephrine and epinephrine will also be lower as dopamine is a precursor for these two neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine levels may be more needed during spring and more so in summer months. </p>
<p>Everyone is unique and a person’s life experience may dictate more of what neurotransmitter may be required on any given day. An example is a highly stressed person is very likely to be needing more serotonin and dopamine and possibly other neurotransmitters as the chronic stress quickly depletes all neurotransmitters and can lead to a state of depression. </p>
<p>Checking deficiency levels of neurotransmitters can help determine what may be needed along with using brainwave measuring device which uses electroencephalography (EEG) may help identify the neurotransmitters needed and balancing levels. </p>
<p>The difference in amounts of brain neurotransmitters found in men and women indicate that men need more dopamine than women and women need more serotonin than men. </p>
<p>Everyone is different and certain health conditions can dictate the requirement of neurotransmitter levels. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine is needed more during the daytime when most of the functions it supports is required but also can rise in sleep along with REM sleep.</p>


<h2 id="acetylcholine-supplementation"><strong>Acetylcholine Supplementation<br /></strong></h2>
<p> Choline and inositol are two important cofactors that form lecithin which are available as a <p> supplement. Lecithin is also available as supplements in capsule forms or as granules. </p>
<p> CDP-choline as a supplement is called citicoline. CDP-choline is the natural form produced in the body, citicoline is the form available in supplements. </p>
<p> Supplemental cofactors for acetylcholine synthesis should be taken early in the morning as it is an excitatory neurotransmitter and will have stimulating effects. </p>
<p> Acetylcholine is needed to stimulate the release of dopamine and serotonin. In women’s menstrual cycle dopamine and serotonin increase alongside estrogen. Since estrogen rise after menstruation which is around Day 7 it may be that more acetylcholine is required during the second half of the follicular phase to help stimulate dopamine and serotonin release. </p>

<h2 id="deficiency-symptoms-of-acetylcholine"><strong>Deficiency Symptoms of Acetylcholine</strong></h2>

<p>Acetylcholine is mostly involved with the pre-fontal cortex of the brain which is what makes humans different from animals in terms of mental capacity. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine main role can be seen in cognitive functions and is needed for memory, learning, and navigation. A deficiency will affect these functions. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine deficiency may be similar to choline deficiency if this key nutrient involved in the production of acetylcholine is absent from the diet. </p>
<p>Low choline levels are associated with various impaired cognitive functions which includes difficulty concentrating, memory loss, and mood changes. A deficiency of choline is linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. </p>
<p>Adequate levels of acetylcholine is also needed to produce sufficient levels of the dopamine pathway neurotransmitters which need acetylcholine to stimulate or activate their synthesis. </p>
<p>Low choline and dopamine levels are characteristic of Parkinson’s disease. </p> 
<p>Signs and symptoms of acetylcholine deficiency include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor memory</li>
<li>Loss of visual or photographic memory</li>
<li>Loss of verbal memory</li>
<li>Problems with recognition (unable to recognize people) </li>

<li>Slow mental responsiveness</li>
<li>Poor spatial orientation (clumsiness or tendency to bump into things) </li>
<li>Impaired sense of navigation or using directions</li>
<li>Apathy</li>
<li>Anhedonia</li>
<li>Impaired cognition, attention and arousal</li>
</ul>
<p>Neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and Parkinson’s disease are linked to lower levels of acetylcholine and dopamine. </p>
<p>Health conditions linked to low levels of acetylcholine include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delirium</li>
<li>Alzheimer’s disease (problems with concentration, memory and attention) </li>
<li>Parkinson’s disease (low acetylcholine can cause symptoms of muscle contractions) </li>
<li>Delirium is caused by low acetylcholine and simultaneously high dopamine </li>
</ul>
<p>Cells or cholinergic neurons that produce and use acetylcholine are damaged in Alzheimer’s disease due to acetylcholine deficiency</p>
<p>A deficiency of choline is also a good indicator for low acetylcholine synthesis. Signs and symptoms of choline deficiency include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Memory loss (short-term, eg. unable to remember where you left things) </li>
<li>Cognitive decline (Eg. reduced reaction time) </li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating (Losing train of thought mid-conversation) </li>
<li>Nerve damage</li>
<li>Oxidative cell damage</li>
<li>Learning disabilities</li>
<li>High homocysteine (risk of hyperhomocysteinaemia) </li>
<li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
<li>Mood changes or disorders </li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Muscle aches</li>
<li>Fatty liver (Liver disease) </li>
<li>Hemorrhagic kidney necrosis</li>
<li>Kidney stones</li>
<li>Mental disorders</li>
<li>Sleeping difficulties</li>
<li>Increased cholesterol</li>
<li>Neurodegenerative diseases</li>
<li>Alzheimer’s disease</li>
<li>Schizophrenia</li>
<li>Osteoporosis</li>
</ul>
<p>Medications known as Anticholinergics can block the action of acetylcholine. These drugs act by blocking the nerve impulses that are involved in involuntary muscle movements and various bodily functions. These medications are used in schizophrenia for treating symptoms of antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal syndrome and many other conditions. </p>
<p>These drugs are also used for a range of conditions which includes muscular spasms, akathisia (unable to remain still or feel compulsion to move, internal restlessness or jitteriness, tension, nervousness, anxiety), parkinsonism (type of Parkinson’s that may be drug induced), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary and sudden movements in the lower face, body or both). </p>
<p>There are also many gastrointestinal disorders where anticholinergics are used including gastrititis, diarrhea, diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, nausea, and vomiting. </p>
<p>Genitourinary disorders such as cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis may also be treated with anticholinergics. Some respiratory disorders may be treated with anticholinergic drugs which includes asthma, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
<p>Anticholingergics have also been used for insomnia with short term treatments. </p>
<p>Anticholinergic drugs include trihexyphenidyl and procyclidine. </p>
<p>Some antihistamines such as diphenhydramine can block acetylcholine. Antihistamines can inhibit REM sleep and NREM sleep which may be why some antihistamines cause parasomnias such as sleep walking. </p>
<p>Like many drugs anticholinergics can cause side effects especially with prolonged use and may worsen some health conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). </p>
<p>Dopamine increases when acetylcholine receptors are activated, a deficiency of acetylcholine may also result in low levels of dopamine. 
Dopamine is found to be low in Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson’s disease. This neurotransmitter is found to be high in people with schizophrenia. </p>
<p>Research studies are showing that large populations are not getting adequate intake of dietary choline. According to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a periodic Government sponsored nutritional survey the percentage of population is up to 90% and in pregnant women this can be between 90% - 95%. [https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2014/10/17/Time-for-the-DGAC-to-look-again-at-choline] [https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782876/]</p>
<p>Choline is an essential nutrient and found to be low in a majority of the population increasing requirements for choline [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782876/]</p>
<p>Causes of acetylcholine deficiency include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Choline deficiency</li>
<li>Insufficient dietary intake of choline</li>
<li>Supplements that increase acetylcholine*</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking various supplements that reduce the activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine will quickly use up choline reserves which can potentially cause symptoms of choline deficiency and increase choline requirements. </p>
<p>Pregnancy increases choline requirements and can prevent neural tube defects. </p>
<p>Choline needs to be obtained through the diet or supplementation if a severe deficiency exists. It is a water soluble nutrient and needs to be replenished daily. People who do not eat eggs or organ meats which are particularly high in choline may be deficient in this key nutrient as well acetylcholine. </p>
<p>Metabolomic profiling can predict if a person will develop liver dysfunction when deprived of dietary choline. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20371621/] </p>


<h2 id="toxicity-symptoms-of-acetylcholine"><strong>Toxicity Symptoms of Acetylcholine</strong></h2>
<p>Excessively raised levels of acetylcholine will increase other excitatory neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of acetylcholine toxicity includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decreased levels of neurotransmitter GABA</li>
<li>Decreased levels of neurotransmitter serotonin</li>
<li>Anxiety </li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Depression</li> 
<li>Hyper vigilance [https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/56315/8/02whole.pdf]
[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.14641] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673653/]</li>

<li>Fear learning [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241223/] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00949-8] </li>
<li>Increased appetite (Increases CB1 receptors promoting eating) </li>
<li>Increased rumination (negative thoughts)* </li>
<li>Delirium</li>
<li>Nightmares</li>
<li>Intense vivid dreaming (increases REM sleep) </li>
<li>Drowsiness</li>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>High body temperature and flushing</li>
<li>Increased release of gastric acid</li>
<li>Mental fatigue</li>
</ul>
<p>Acetylcholine is similar to cortisol in that only small amounts are needed to give energy and help with focus as well as the other functions of the neurotransmitter. However, getting too much acetylcholine is counterproductive and causes an imbalance of other neurotransmitters. Getting too little of acetylcholine is also not helpful as acetylcholine is needed to activate other neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Balance is crucial with all neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>*Rumination involves focusing on problems, causes and consequence rather than solutions [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3837351/] </p>
<p>Having too little or too much acetylcholine can cause imbalance of other neurotransmitters. </p> 
<p>Glutamate is the first most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter found within the body. Acetylcholine is the second most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the body. When glutamate becomes low, acetylcholine takes over and becomes the main excitatory neurotransmitter. Glutamate is important as it converts to GABA which is a very important inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps calm the nervous system. If glutamate is low or conversion to GABA is impaired there is over excitation of the nerves. </p>
<p>When acetylcholine is high it also inhibits GABA and serotonin. </p>
<p>Causes of acetylcholine toxicity include:</p>
<li>Excess supplementation (of choline or other substance promoting acetylcholine synthesis) </li>
<li>Nicotine excess</li>
<li>Cholinergics</li>
</ul>
<p>Some medications known as cholinergics can increase acetylcholine. Cholinergics are used for various health conditions which includes Alzheimer’s diseases, glaucoma, bladder control (urinary retention) and severe muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis). </p>
<p>Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine and taking excess supplements or even medications that increase acetylcholine levels can lead to excess build up of acetylcholine. 
<p>Exposure to chemical toxins which includes pesticides such as organophosphate (OP) and nerve agents used in warfare is linked to high levels of acetylcholine in the body which can build up over time. The toxic levels can cause acetylcholine to build up in the nervous system causing the following symptoms: </p>
<ul>
<li>Increased saliva</li>
<li>Increased tear production
<li>Small pupils</li>
<li>Diarrhoea</li> 
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
Sweating</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Fainting</li>
<li>Mental changes</li>
<li>Muscle twitching</li>
Muscle tremors</li>
<li>Convulsions</li>
<li>Paralysis</li>
<li>Wheezing</li>
<li>Respiratory arrest</li> 
<li>Confusion</li>
</ul>
<p> [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470430/]</p>
<p>People can be exposed to these toxic chemicals via the skin, breathing or by ingesting. </p>
<p>Pesticides are commonly found on non-organic fruits and vegetables treated with pesticides which includes rice, wheat, apples, strawberries, grapes, green leafy vegetable and many other food sources. These same toxins can be found in household products such as ant and roach killers. </p>
<p>Most people are likely to be exposed to organophosphates by eating food grown with pesticides. </p>
<p>High levels of acetylcholine are linked to vivid dreams, most likely due to its activity during REM sleep where most vivid dreaming occurs. Vivid dreams are linked to various health conditions such as stress, anxiety, cancer, heart disease, depression, schizophrenia and other mental health conditions. It is more likely that in many cases these are linked to high levels of acetylcholine which can reduce other neurotransmitters. </p> 
<p>Excess acetylcholine causes symptoms of both muscarinic and nicotinic toxicity symptoms which includes: </p>
<li>Cramps</li>
<li>Increased salivation</li>
<li>Lacrimation</li>
<li>Muscular weakness</li>
<li>Paralysis</li>
<li>Muscular fasciculation</li>
<li>Diarrhoea</li>
<li>[Blurry vision</li>
</ul>
<p>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482433/]</p>
<p>Toxic effects of nicotine are similar to excess acetylcholine which in high amounts can cause destruction of brain tissues. The following are symptoms of a nicotine overdose (If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking nicotine, seek medical attention immediately):</p>
<ul>
<li>Vomiting – can begin in just 15 minutes after ingestion or use of nicotine</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Involuntary muscle twitching</li>
<li>Abnormal heart rhythms (Fast or irregular heartbeat) </li>
<li>Slow heart rate</li>
<li>Fluctuating blood pressure</li>
<li>Heart failure</li>
<li>Muscle paralysis</li>
<li>Excess fluid in the lungs’ air passages</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Pounding in the ears</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Diarrhoea
<li>Stomach pains</li>
<li>Nervousness</li>
<li>Excessive salivation</li>
<li>Tremor</li>
<li>Hypertension</li>
<li>Tachycardia</li>
<li>Ataxia</li>
</ul>
<p>Hives, itching, rash, redness or swelling of the skin may be due to using nicotine patch on same area of skin which is why many manufacturers instruct users to change area for the patch to avoid this. </p>
<p>Excess choline supplementation can cause an excess in acetylcholine levels. </p>
<p>More than 3g of choline per day has shown to cause low blood pressure which can increase risk of heart disease. </p>
<p>The body and brain try to maintain homeostasis so that neurotransmitters are balanced. Neurotransmitters in the body and brain require a delicate balance so that they are working optimally. Too little or too much of any neurotransmitter can tip the scale and create an imbalance. </p>
<p>When neurotransmitters are out of balance or each are in varying ratios where one neurotransmitter is higher than another this can create certain health conditions. </p>
<p>Furthermore neurotransmitters require certain enzymes and nutrients that support these enzymes to help break down the neurotransmitter once its functions has ended. </p>
<p>High acetylcholine inhibits various neurotransmitters and may cause deficiency of these such as the symptoms of serotonin deficiency. </p>
<p>Some example of neurotransmitter imbalances are seen when acetylcholine and norepinephrine are high with low serotonin, a combination of which results in anxiety, emotional lability (rapid exaggerated changes to mood), irritability, anger, aggressiveness, negative rumination, impatience, and impulsiveness. </p>
<p>High acetylcholine with low levels of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin will cause a state of depression. </p>
<p>Increasing serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine can lower acetylcholine levels. </p>
<p>Subtle changes can occur in the types of food eaten to determine production of neurotransmitters such as food sources of tryptophan for serotonin, tyrosine for dopamine and choline for acetylcholine. </p>
<p>Carbohydrate foods which causes a spike in insulin and can increase serotonin uptake can reduce acetylcholine levels. </p>
<p>Insulin can prevent release of acetylcholine in the body </p>
<p>Acetylcholine tends to suppress thirst and insulin increases thirst</p>
<p>Acetylcholine in the brain is dependent on the nutritional content of choline available whether through diet or supplementation and will be synthesised in proportion to the amount available. This means anyone with high acetylcholine will be sensitive to choline through food or supplements. High choline intake will increase acetylcholine proportionately. </p>
<p>Acetylcholine may also become high if other neurotransmitters are too low. </p>
<p>Acetylicholine is involved in epilepsy and found to be high after an epileptic episode [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771384/]</p>
<p>Although nicotine as a nootropic has vast benefits in most circumstances it can be addictive especially for those who smoke. Nicotine acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and activate dopamine reward pathways. </p>
<p>Psychomotor deficits associated with aging and hypoxia are linked to changes in the production and release of dopamine and acetylcholine [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36447257/]</p>
<p>Certain medications known as AChE inhibitors or cholinesterase inhibitors increase levels of acetylcholine by inhibiting the action of enzymes that are needed to break down the neurotransmitter such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme. </p>
<p>Health conditions linked to acetylcholine toxicity include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Parkinson's disease</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Tumors</li>
</ul>
<p>Dopamine is needed for the control of motor function and voluntary movement. Like acetylcholine it helps regulate coordination and muscle movements. </p>
<p>Deficiency is linked to various conditions that affect movement such as Parkinson’s disease which is characterized by tremors. </p>
<p>Parkinson’s disease which is a neurodegenerative condition is linked to and imbalance of acetylcholine and dopamine. Particularly dopamine is found to be significantly reduced which may cause acetylcholine to take over and increase to higher levels. Parkinson’s is characterized by involuntary movements, tremors, difficulty thinking and problems with mood. When acetylcholine increases the muscles are over excited which causes involuntary jerking movements and tremors. </p>
<p>Although much is not discovered about the causes of Parkinson’s disease there are studies showing that people with the condition have high levels of pesticides and toxins. Medications known as anticholinergics for Parkinson’s inhibit acetylcholine which can then allow dopamine levels to rise. </p>
<p>Anticholinergic drugs inhibits the action of acetylcholine (ACh) but may cause side effects which includes confusion, memory loss, hallucinations and blurry vision. </p>
<p>Studies showing that cancer cell processes such as proliferation and apoptosis, are mediated by overexpression of AChRs in different kinds of tumors [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31536927/]</p>
<p>Studies are showing that tumors contain high levels of AChE where AChE inhibitors may potentially be used against some types of cancer. </p>
