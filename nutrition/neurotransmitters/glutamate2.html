<h2 id="description">What is Glutamate?</h2>
<p>Glutamate is an amino acid and main excitatory neurotransmitter. It is the most important neurotransmitter in the brain. </p>
<p>The release of glutamate (GLU) occurs in the hippocampal region. Other neurotransmitter release in this region includes GABA, acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT). [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9882017/" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>Although glutamate is a nonessential amino acid as a neurotransmitter it has very important functions and is needed for optimal health. </p>
<p>Glutamate is a nonessential amino acid as the body is able to produce it and maintain requirements. </p>
<p>Glutamate is essential for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Glutamate is the main brain neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. </p>
<p>Glutamate can be found in over 90% of all synapses in the brain. Glutamate receptors are located throughout the brain and spinal cord in neurons and glia. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62187/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>An important role of glutamate is to send signals to other cells in the central nervous system. </p>

<h2 id="health-benefits">Health Benefits of Glutamate</h2>
<h3>Needed for healthy cognitive functions</h3>
<p>Glutamate is important for healthy cognitive functions and facilitates learning and memory with glutamatergic neurons playing an important role in synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>Glutamate helps nerve cells in the brain send and receive information from other cells. </p> 
<p>Glutamate also helps with the formation of proteins. </p>
<h3>Needed for synthesis of GABA</h3>
<p>Glutamate which acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter is one of the essential precursors for the neurotransmitter GABA. GABA is inhibitory which has calming effects on the nervous system whilst glutamate is excitatory and fires up the CNS. </p>
<p>As a neurotransmitter Glutamate helps relay signals to the nervous system. </p>
<p>GABA is a calming neurotransmitter and plays an important role in behavior, cognition and physiological response to stress. </p>


<h2 id="agonist-synergist">Agonist / Synergist</h2>
<p><strong>Minerals</strong> Magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, lithium</p>
<p><strong>Vitamins</strong> B9</p>
<p><strong>Amino Acids</strong> Glutamine, BCAAs</p>
<p><strong>Neurotransmitters</strong> GABA </p>
<p><strong>Other</strong> Intense exercise, aminotransferase, glutaminase </p>
<p>GABA is made in brain cells from glutamate (GLU) and in the nervous system. 
<p>Bergamot may have protective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity. It also increases GABA levels</p>
<p>GABA is made from glutamate</p>
<p>The enzyme glutamate decarboxylase which needs P5P (active form of vitamin B6) converts the main excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate into the main inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA</p>
<p>Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine and also the precursor for GABA</p>
<p>GABA counteracts the effects of glutamate possibly as glutamate begins to convert to GABA</p>
<p>Glucose is metabolized to glutamate by the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes </p>
<p>Lithium reduces glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission and increases GABA. This is dependent on changes needed in neurotransmitter networks for achieving homeostasis</p>
<p>BCAAs are needed for the production of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the brain due to the role of these amino acids as nitrogen donors [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK209312/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Magnesium regulates neurotransmitter glutamate</p>
<p>Intense exercise increases glutamate and GABA</p>
<p>Serotonin modulates GABA and glutamate</p> 
<p>*If glutamate is unable to properly convert into GABA this can cause high glutamate levels which can lead to health problems</p>
<p>Vitamin B9 (Folic acid or folate) contain glutamate and can lead to additional levels of glutamate </p>
<p>CBD can stimulate the release of glutamate and dopamine by stimulating adenosine receptor. </p>
<p>Magnesium is also required by glutathione for its synthesis</p>
<p>Glutamine amino acid converts into glutamate in the body </p>
<p>Glutamine can be processed in the metabolic pathway to produce either glutamate or glutathione which is the potent antioxidant that helps boost the immune system. Caution should be taken to avoid excess production of glutamate which can lead to excitotoxicity. </p>
<p>Glutamic acid is an amino acid needed for the biosynthesis of proteins and is a component of monosodium glutamate (MSG) </p>
<p>Glutamine is different from glutamic acid and the common body building supplement taken by body builders and athletes </p>
<p>Glutamine synthetase is the manganese-activated enzyme needed to convert glutamate to glutamine</p>
<p>Manganese plays an important role in collagen production. It is required for the synthesis of the amino acid proline essential for collagen production and can aid in wound healing. Glutamic acid is also needed for proline synthesis. </p>
<p>Some studies have shown that transdermal application of manganese, calcium and zinc to chronic wounds may improve wound healing [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15117065/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Manganese has an important role in cognitive function which helps to transmit electrical impulses to the brain efficiently. A deficiency of manganese has been linked to a number of neurological disorders. Manganese supports healthy brain function with its powerful antioxidant ability to reduce free radical damage throughout the body. Many research is revealing a direct link between oxidative stress which increases free radicals in the body. In addition to this it’s important that levels of manganese are not in the higher range as excess manganese has been linked to many neurodegenerative disorders, which research is showing is due to intake from excess manganese from pollution in the air. [<a href="" target="_blank">R</a>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10852840/] </p>
<p>The main routes glutamate can be synthesized is through alpha-ketoglutarate by the enzyme aminotransferase and glutamine by the enzyme glutaminase. </p>
<p>Phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG) enzyme converts glutamine to glutamate and ammonia in the glutaminolysis pathway in mitochondria. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4230542/]</p>
<p>Phosphate is formed when phosphorus is combined with oxygen in the body. Most of the phosphorus in the body is combined with oxygen. </p>
<p>Many of the phosphorous compounds are neuro-protective. Several disorders and health conditions such as seizures, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and dementia may be related to low and high levels of phosphorus.
[<a href=" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5289565/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>


<p>Phosphorus works with many other key nutrients within the body to maintain healthy neurological functions. These include vitamin B3 and vitamin B6. Omega 3 fatty acids, important for proper brain function, are made more bioavailable through a phosphate compound. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5622802/" target="_blank">R</a>]
</p>
<p>Cortisone stimulates glutamate production</p>
<p>Histidine can also be converted into histamine and glutamate. Low glutamate levels has been linked to Alzheimer’s. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21921084/]</p>
<p>Histamine stimulates release of glutamate [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858014/]</p>
<p>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) helps regulate levels of glutamate</p>
<p>NAC is a precursor of glutathione</p>
<p>The brain can be subjected to inflammation, free radical and oxidative damage which will impact cognitive functions such as memory and affect mood. Antioxidants help to prevent this damage. </p>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) is an important antioxidant produced by the liver. It is made from cysteine, glycine and glutamate / glutamic acid. An adequate supply of these amino acids is needed for the production of glutathione. </p>
<p>Selenium has many functions in the body and works synergistically with other nutrients. It is an important part of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) which is an antioxidant complex or enzyme that helps to prevent oxidative damage (reduce peroxides), stabilize cell membranes and reduce platelet aggregation which can help to reduce risk of atherosclerosis. Vitamin E is another antioxidant and also needed for GPX. </p>
<p>Deficiency of glutathione and its cofactors such as cysteine or selenium and vitamin E may also contribute to thyroid disease. Glutathione along with cofactor antioxidants has anti-inflammatory properties reducing free radicals and preventing oxidative damage. </p>
<p>It has been postulated that high intake of sugars and starches can reduce glutathione levels and some evidence suggests that the levels of this potent antioxidant is found to be low in cases of type 2 diabetes. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5991679/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Caffeine induces dopamine and glutamate release in the shell of the nucleus accumbens [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12151508/" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>When glutamate levels increase the neurotransmitters dopamine*, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, endorphins, oxytocin also increase</p>
<p>*dopamine levels may also decrease</p>
<p>Endocannabinoids maintain glutamate activation within physiological limits [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5342457/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>When glutamate levels increase the hormones cortisol, epinephrine (adrenaline), oxytocin also increases</p>
<p>Oxytocin receptors are found on dopamine and glutamate neurons</p>
<p>The following are antagonists but have beneficial effects as they reduce glutamate toxicity so can also act as agonists: </p>
<p>Testosterone protects neurons against glutamate-induced toxicity and oxidative stress [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29799288/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8104320/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA-sulfate (DHEAS) protects neurons from neurotoxic effects of glutamate [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC19202/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Thyroid hormone protects neurons from glutamate toxic effects by stimulating uptake [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18543341/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Estrogen and progesterone regulates glutamate levels and protects neurons from neurotoxic effects. In the luteal phase during womens monthly cycle these two hormones also support GABA [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20980684/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Celastrus paniculatus protects neurons from excess glutamate</p>
<p>Excitatory neurotransmitters are likely to release under the faster brainwave frequencies such as Beta and Gamma brainwave frequencies. </p>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089991/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Some medications for Parkinson’s disease such as Amantadine are glutamate antagonists and are used as treatment of Parkinson’s symptoms </p>
<p>Alcohol prevents communication between nerve cells through its interaction with glutamate and GABA receptors</p>
<p>Communication between the nerve cells are activated when glutamate binds to its receptor in the brain whereas communication between nerve cells are inhibited when GABA binds to its receptor in the brain. The net effect of this is slowing down the brain activity. Reduced activity in the brain can inhibit social anxiety and conscious self control. When nerve communication are significantly silenced motor skills are affected and is evident when a person is drunk who will find difficulty walking in a straight line. Slurred speech and slowed actions under the influence of alcohol are often the result of this inhibited communication between nerves. </p>
<p>Amphetamines change the glutamate levels in the brain possibly causing a circulatory disturbance of the glutamine-glutamate-GABA circuit. A single dose of Amphetamine type stimulants (ATS) has shown to decrease levels of glutamine, glutamate, and GABA </p>
<p>This action of ATS is thought to be due to the excess stimulation of the glutamate system increasing the need for glutamate and subsequently insufficient GABA levels which needs glutamate for synthesis
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186735/" target="_blank">R</a>]
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419710/" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>When GABA levels increase the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and glutamate decrease</p>
<p>When glutamate levels increase the neurotransmitters serotonin and GABA decrease</p>
<p>When glutamate levels increase the hormones progesterone, estrogen and thyroid hormones also decrease – many of these steroid hormones are protective whilst they lower glutamate levels they protect neurons from excitotoxic effects of excess glutamate. See agonists for more details</p>
<p>Dopamine receptors on the glutamatergic terminals have been shown to enhance glutamate release with the use of stimulants. Dopamine which is also an excitatory neurotransmitter, increases the excitatory neurotoxicity of glutamate [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3552338/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6725423/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4345909/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419710" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4403511" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>Dopamine modulates glutamatergic transmission [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4345909/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Glutamate can facilitate or inhibit control over dopamine release [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9195606/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic fibers modulates dopaminergic system [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26317601/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in glutamate metabolism. Glutamate is metabolized by GDH back to alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia (NH3). [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22038055/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>High concentrations of GDH is found in the mitochondria of liver, heart, muscle, and kidney. </p>
<p>GDH is a zinc containing protein which also requires vitamin B3 (niacinamide) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) as a coenzyme [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6192663/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Vitamin B3 (Nicotinic acid) helps eliminate glutamate</p>
<p>GDH deficiency impairs recognition memory [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898404/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Carnitine may prevent ammonia and glutamate neurotoxicity [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12602515/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Omega 3 fatty acids are needed by glutamate receptor [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30367533/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Magnesium inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and supports GABA synthesis</p>
<p>Magnesium acts as a voltage-gated antagonist at the glutamate, N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptor. </p>
<p>Magnesium regulates neurotransmitter glutamate and GABA activity by modulating the activation of NMDA glutamate and GABAA receptors. This can have a calming and relaxing effect. Magnesium does this by binding to GABA receptors in the brain and has a calming effect on the brain and helps relax central nervous system and the muscles reducing excitation. </p>
<p>Taurine amino acid is an agonist of GABAA receptors and counteracts excess glutamate levels [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30892104/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Taurine amino acid protects brain from excess glutamate levels and calms GABA receptors</p>
<p>Ashwaganda protects against glutamate damage and also reduces cortisol [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25789768/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Chamomile inhibits glutamate and increases GABA</p>
<p>Bee pollen demonstrates neuroprotective benefits on excess glutamate [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28532421/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>CBD protects against glutamate</p>
<p>B-Caryophyllene is an analgesic found in several essential oils and has shown to protect against glutamate excitotoxicity [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25194788/" target="_blank">R</a>]
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5440900" target="_blank">R</a>]
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26007643" target="_blank">R</a>] </p>
<p>Calcium stimulates glutamate release but calcium influx can lead to neuronal cell death likely through high calcium and high glutamate [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC26999/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8791003/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Calcium levels should be balanced with fat soluble vitamins A, D and K. Calcium and magnesium ratios also need to be addressed. </p>
<p>Zinc is also needed to be balanced with calcium levels. Boron can also help with utilizing calcium and magnesium levels.</p>


<h2 id="food-sources">Food Sources of Glutamate</h2>
<p>Glutamate is found in most high protein foods. </p>
<p>Foods containing precursor nutrients of glutamate can help increase glutamate levels. Glutamine is one of the main amino acid precursor which can convert to glutamate. Most high protein foods includes glutamate. </p>
<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a common food additive and is a source of glutamate, however excess amounts are linked to adverse side effects. </p>
<p>There are also natural food sources and most food contains some levels of glutamate, however some contain higher levels and some have much lower amounts. </p>
<p>Glutamate can be found in high amounts in parmesan, roquefort cheeses, soy, soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, walnuts, processed meats, cured ham and dried shiitake mushrooms. </p>
<p>Most mushrooms contain glutamate such as white button mushrooms and in amounts lower than in shiitake mushrooms. </p>
<p>Moderated amounts can be found in some seafood such as anchovies, scallops and oysters. </p>
<p>Grape juice and tomato juice also contain moderate amounts of glutamate. </p>
<p>Peas also contain moderate amounts of glutamate and can increase glutamate load if eaten in excess and regularly. </p>
<p>Low amounts can be found in corn and potatoes. </p>
<p>Readymade or processed food products will have food labels listing ingredients that have hidden glutamate. </p>
<p>MSG contains about 78% of glutamate and is commonly added to fast food and processed food. </p>
<p>The following substances contain varying amounts of glutamate which can be found written on food labels:</p>

<p>While some of these ingredients may not be harmful in small amounts in healthy people, a diet consisting of excess ready-made, fast food and processed food using multiple ingredients with glutamate can contribute to glutamate load. Regular consumption will increase glutamate to very high levels causing many health issues. </p>
<p>If excess glutamate is present just small amounts of MSG laden food may cause health issues. People sensitive to glutamate will have some reactions to even just a small amount. </p>
<p>Some foods can be eaten as alternative to the glutamate foods listed above but still may contain some glutamate. These include cheddar cheese, cod, mackerel and salmon. </p>
<p>Some herbs can counteract the negative effects and balance levels of glutamate which includes lemon balm, chamomile, and passionflower. These herbs have a natural calming effect and support GABA levels. Antioxidant rich superfruits such as blueberries can also help protect from toxic effects of high glutamate. </p>

<h2 id="recommended-daily-allowance">Recommended Daily Allowance</h2>
<p>There are no set amounts of recommended neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter synthesis depend on the nutrients obtained from the diet or supplementation. Brainwave frequencies and other practices such as meditation can also effect levels of neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are made from protein and amino acids. They also need other cofactors such as vitamins and minerals for synthesis. </p>
<p>Dietary protein is therefore essential and getting adequate, sufficient supply of all nutrients in the correct balance is essential. </p>
<p>A healthy adult needs between 40 and 70 grams of daily protein intake. This can go up to as much as 90 grams for active and athletic people. </p>
<p>Diet and nutritional supplementation can be tweaked to meet the requirement of necessary nutrients and ensuring adequate levels of neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters operate at different times of the day and are largely dictated by light exposure. Serotonin and dopamine are produced mostly during daylight hours. During dark hours the serotonin converts to melatonin and more GABA is present. </p>
<p>Brainwaves also correspond with the different neurotransmitters. In the morning the brain has alpha waves which increase to beta waves throughout the day. Gamma waves may also facilitate the daylight hours and ideal for higher learning. The alpha and beta waves facilitate acetylcholine and dopamine. </p>
<p>Other factors such as the seasons and a woman’s monthly menstrual cycle can also determine the amount of specific neurotransmitters needed and at which point of the cycle. For example in the luteal phase GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter as this part of the phase we see a spike in the hormone progesterone which works synergistically with this calming neurotransmitter. Serotonin will also be present at this time as well as more conversion into melatonin to facilitate sleep. This indicates that glutamate will be required prior to a rise of progesterone and GABA.  </p>
<p>Dopamine will be more available during the follicular phase which seems to increase with the rise of the female reproductive hormone estrogen. </p>
<p>In northern climates during winter with the lack of sunlight there is likely to be a lower production of serotonin or higher amounts of this may convert to melatonin possibly through daylight hours shortening. This may pick up slightly as spring emerges. Many people also find that spring makes them feel motivated. </p>
<p>Everyone is unique and a person’s life experience may dictate more of what neurotransmitter may be required on any given day. An example is a highly stressed person is very likely to be needing more serotonin and dopamine and possibly other neurotransmitters as the chronic stress quickly depletes all neurotransmitters and can lead to a state of depression. </p>
<p>Checking deficiency levels of neurotransmitters can help determine what may be needed along with using brainwave measuring device which uses electroencephalography (EEG) may help identify the neurotransmitters needed and balancing levels. </p>
<p>Circadian rhythms are also of importance and can help determine the neurotransmitter needed at each part of the day. Glutamate release is higher during waking hours and reduced in sleep. [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4166758/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>

<h2 id="glutamate-supplementation">Glutamate Supplementation<br /></h2>
<p>Glutamine is the main amino acid precursor for glutamate and is often the most common to supplement with in order to increase production of glutamate. It is also important to have adequate levels of the necessary cofactor nutrients to help with serotonin synthesis. </p>
<p>Other cofactors listed under Agonist heading are also helpful as well as knowing antagonists that may help reduce the likely toxicity of excess glutamate production. </p>

<h2 id="deficiency-symptoms-of-glutamate">Deficiency Symptoms of Glutamate</h2>
<p>Glutamate is one of the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter making a deficiency unlikely in most cases. Most people produce enough glutamate and may not require supplementation. </p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of glutamate deficiency include:</p>
<li>Insomnia (Sleeplessness) </li>
<li>Memory loss</li>
<li>Concentration difficulty</li>
<li>Mental exhaustion</li>
<li>Low energy level</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Psychosis </li>
<li>Coma</li> 
<li>Death</li>
<p>During glutamate resistance or reduced glutamate acetylcholine becomes the main excitatory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>Glutamate is the first most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter found within the body. Acetylcholine is the second most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the body. When glutamate becomes low, acetylcholine takes over and becomes the main excitatory neurotransmitter. Glutamate is important as it converts to GABA which is a very important inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps calm the nervous system. If glutamate is low or conversion to GABA is impaired there is over excitation of the nerves. When acetylcholine is high it also inhibits GABA and serotonin. </p>
<p>Causes of glutamate deficiency includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aging – glutamate levels decline with age</li>
<li>Lack of serotonin </li>
</ul>
<p>Studies on animals has shown low glutamate and GABA in the brains of thiamine deficient rats [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2819010/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Glutamate, GABA, serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine are all involved with inflammation, immunity, mood, gastrointestinal functioning, heart rate, attention, memory, coordination and pain. These neurotransmitters can be affected by amphetamines, depressants and opiates. </p>
<p>Each of these main neurotransmitters have an effect upon each other either by stimulating release, inhibiting release or associated with the conversion to each other such as glutamate which converts to GABA and dopamine which converts to norepinephrine. </p>
<p>Altering levels of any one of these main neurotransmitters can change the functions or availability of the other neurotransmitters.</p>

<h2 id="toxicity-symptoms-of-glutamate">Toxicity Symptoms of Glutamate</h2>
<p>Although glutamate plays an essential role in normal brain functioning, levels of this neurotransmitter are strictly controlled by the body and excessive levels can be detrimental causing irreversible damage. </p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of excess glutamate includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Restlessness</li>
<li>Panic attacks </li>
<li>Impulsivity</li>
<li>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) </li>
<li>Depression</p>
<li>Excitotoxicity (death of brain cells) </li>
<li>Seizures (from cell death) [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164853/" target="_blank">R</a>]</li>
<li>Pain amplification (Hyperalgesia) </li>
<li>Low glutathione</li>
<li>Excitotoxins overexcite cells to their death and lead to seizures</li>
</ul>
<p>Altered levels of neurotransmitters in the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic system play a role in anxiety and depression. </p>
<p>Glutamate levels need to be balanced and available in the right amount as having too much glutamate can cause excitotoxicity leading to damages neurons or cell death </p>
<p>Glutamate is needed for normal brain function however excess glutamate is implicated in neurological diseases and movement disorders which includes tremors and gait disturbances. </p>
<p>Health conditions linked to high glutamate levels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fibromyalgia Syndrome (chronic pain is the main symptom) [<a href=" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28033157/" target="_blank">R</a>]</li>
<li>Parkinson's disease (linked to dyskinesias, dystonias, myoclonus) </li>
<li>Parkinsonism </li>
<li>Restless legs</li>
<li>Huntington’s Disease [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20406248/" target="_blank">R</a>]</li>
<li>Multiple sclerosis (MS) </li>
<li>Alzheimer's disease</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
<li>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS). </li>
<li>Autism</li>
</ul>
<p>Studies are showing high ratio of glutamate to GABA leads to certain depressive mood disorders with indication that these pair of neurotransmitters which can release together need to be optimally balanced. High glutamate to GABA ratio may be the cause of feelings of disappointment.
[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25237099/" target="_blank">R</a>]
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4305433/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Autistic children also prefer to eat junk food and are often found to be picky over food [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7815266/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Autism is characterized by symptoms such as anxiety, tics, and inattention. These symptoms are likely to be caused by high levels of glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is one of the main neurotransmitter present in cases of autism. </p>
<p>Brain damage after strokes are likely to be due to excess brain levels of glutamate release. High glutamate is one of the main leading factor which can cause brain damage</p>
<p>High glutamate will cause glutathione to get too low and reduce immune function and increase inflammation</p>
<p>Toxic levels of glutamate will cause health issues in neuronal health, cognitive functions, memory and mood. </p>
<p>Ammonia is a substance that contains nitrogen produced through the catabolism of protein. Having high levels of ammonia is toxic. </p>
<p>Lactate has shown to promote glutamine uptake and metabolism which can lead to glutamate production. </p>
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4825768/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>High lactate and high ammonia (hyperammonemia) in the blood can cause excess glutamate. [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18716864/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Excess glutamate production can arise from excess lactate build-up as lactate helps glutamine uptake which is used to produce the glutamate which causes excess ammonia in the blood. </p>
<p>High glutamate concentrations in the brain is linked to loss of glutamate transporter activity in brain in acute liver failure and hyperammonemia which may be the cause of hyperexcitability and cerebral edema seen in hyperammonemic disorders. [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12020607/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Studies are showing a link between glutamine in tumours and cancer growth 
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627209/" target="_blank">R</a>] [<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2013/639401/" target="_blank">R</a>]</p>
<p>Glutamine metabolism has been studied for a potential adjunct in the treatment for cancer
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5746034/] </p>
<p>High lactate can also be the result of a lack of oxygen which may explain why strenuous exercise increases lactic acid (from the increased respiratory rate and need of more oxygen in the cells). Lactic acid has shown to increase during strenuous exercise and can be directly felt in sore aching muscles although this is temporary. Lactic acid (lactate) can accumulate within many tissues such as the muscles. Glutamate enters the bloodstream from storage site. </p>
<p>Pyruvate is converted to lactate when there is lack of oxygen and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is reoxidized to NAD+. </p>
<p>When oxygen is present pyruvate converts to acetyl-CoA and then enters the citric acid cycle. The breakdown of glucose with sufficient oxygen can help form more ATP. Pyruvate then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle). </p>
<p>One cause of high lactate (LA) is lack of oxygen (hypoxia). Oxygen needs to be available in the blood for glucose to be converted into energy. If there is insufficient levels of oxygen the lactate or lactic acid builds up in the body and if not eliminated can lead to major health problems. </p>
<p>There are other ways that lactic acid can also build up. 
<p>Impaired liver function (Liver disease or liver damage) will prevent breakdown of lactic acid in the blood causing high concentrations to accumulate. A high lactic acid value is an indicator for lactic acidosis. </p>
<p>Lactic acidosis can also be caused by severe dehydration, blood related disorders such as anemia or leukemia. </p>
<p>Glutamate stored inside brain cells makes up for about 99.99% of total glutamate levels. </p>
<p>Intracellular (inside cells) glutamate is inactive, with extracellular (outside of cells) stored glutamate found to be active and the main cause for excitation. </p>
<p>Glutamate is an excitotoxic neurotransmitter if allowed to get too high. It is also a precursor to the inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) </p>
<p>Excess glutamate stops glutathione production at the cellular level and if there is insufficient glutathione it can lead to free radical and cell damage as it is one of the main antioxidant to help transport toxic substances out of the cell. </p>
<p>Causes of high glutamate levels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excess glutamate or glutamic acid supplementation</li>
<li>Capsules made of gelatin</li>
<li>Brain injury</li>
<li>Dietary intake of junk food and or processed food</li>
<li>High MSG intake (mostly found in junk food) </li>
<li>Impaired liver functions (includes alcoholic liver, non-alcoholic fatty liver)</li>
</ul>
<p>Capsules made of gelatin consist of up to ten percent of MSG which may cause issues if glutamate is already high and if gelatin based capsules are taken frequently and in excess. </p>
<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) food additive is a neurotoxin commonly found in junk food and processed food. It can be found in food packaging labelled as ‘natural flavorings’. MSG improves the taste of food by over stimulating the cells on the tongue. Eating junk food with MSG can lead to junk food addiction. MSG is derived from glutamic acid. </p>
<p>Excess intake of MSG can cause symptoms of headaches, flushing, or sweating, hives, itching, throat swelling, and abdominal which has been documented to occur after eating Chinese food containing MSG. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5278591/] [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20968043/]</p>
<p>If too much glutamate is already present in the body glutamate supplements can cause adverse side effects. </p>
<p>Liver function can be impaired in the presence of viral infections, hepatitis, parasite load, digestive issue, toxins, excess alcohol and many other causes. Healthy liver, kidney and digestive functions are important for overall health. </p>
<p>Glutamate levels may be balanced through taking nutrients that help prevent excess levels and excitotoxicity.</p>
